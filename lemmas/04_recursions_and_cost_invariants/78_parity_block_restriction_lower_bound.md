# Parity-Block Restriction Lower Bound

## Statement

Let

$$
f:\{0,1\}^{n}\to\{0,1\}.
$$

Suppose a restriction of $f$ leaves two disjoint sets of free variables $Z$ and $Y$, with

$$
\lvert Z\rvert=k,
$$

and on that restricted subcube has the form

$$
f_{\rho}(z,y)
=
\left(\bigoplus_{j=1}^{k}z_j\right)\oplus T(y)
$$

for some Boolean function $T$ on the $Y$ variables. Then

$$
\deg_{\pm}(f)\geq k+\deg_{\pm}(T),
$$

and hence

$$
H^{*}(f)\geq k+\deg_{\pm}(T).
$$

The same conclusion holds if the restricted function is the complement of the displayed parity-block form.

> **Interpretation.** A lower bound does not require finding a pure parity restriction. It is enough to find a parity block that modulates any residual hard subfunction on the remaining free variables.

## Proof

Restricting variables cannot increase threshold degree: any strict sign polynomial for $f$ restricts to a strict sign polynomial for $f_{\rho}$ of no larger degree. Therefore

$$
\deg_{\pm}(f)\geq\deg_{\pm}(f_{\rho}).
$$

By the parity-block threshold-degree amplifier [77_parity_block_threshold_degree_amplifier.md](77_parity_block_threshold_degree_amplifier.md),

$$
\deg_{\pm}(f_{\rho})=k+\deg_{\pm}(T).
$$

Thus

$$
\deg_{\pm}(f)\geq k+\deg_{\pm}(T).
$$

The head lower bound follows from the general threshold-degree lower bound [xor_n_bits.md](../01_foundations_and_normal_form/xor_n_bits.md):

$$
H^{*}(f)\geq\deg_{\pm}(f)\geq k+\deg_{\pm}(T).
$$

If the restriction is the complement of the displayed parity-block form, the same proof applies because complementing a Boolean function preserves threshold degree. $\blacksquare$

## Consequences

The usual affine-parity restriction lower bound is the special case where $T$ is constant.

The new certificate can be stronger when the residual $T$ already has nontrivial threshold degree. For example, a restriction of the form

$$
\left(\bigoplus_{j=1}^{k}z_j\right)
\oplus
\mathrm{XOR}_{r}(y)
$$

certifies

$$
H^{*}(f)\geq k+r.
$$
