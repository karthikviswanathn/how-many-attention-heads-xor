# Affine-Cylinder Cofactor Recursion

## Statement

Let

$$
f:\{0,1\}\times\{0,1\}^{m}\to\{0,1\},
$$

and write its cofactors as

$$
f_b(y):=f(b,y)
\qquad
(b\in\{0,1\}).
$$

Let

$$
r_b:=\operatorname{actc}(f_b).
$$

Then

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
\operatorname{actc}(f)
\leq
\operatorname{sactc}(f)
\leq
1+m+2(r_0+r_1)+\min\{r_0,r_1\}.
$$

Equivalently, for either choice of base cofactor $b\in\{0,1\}$,

$$
\operatorname{sactc}(f)
\leq
1+m+3r_b+2r_{1-b}.
$$

> **Interpretation.** This is a coarse Shannon recursion for the affine-cylinder invariant. It pays one affine block, up to one changed-slope cylinder per remaining coordinate, and at most twice the cofactor cylinder costs when supports are lifted by the split bit.

## Proof

Choose strict affine-cylinder scores for $f_0$ and $f_1$ achieving costs $r_0$ and $r_1$:

$$
S_b(y)
=
A_b(y)
+
\sum_{\gamma\in\Gamma_b}c_{b,\gamma}C_{\gamma}(y),
$$

where

$$
A_b(y)=a_b+\sum_{i=1}^{m}\alpha_{b,i}y_i.
$$

Let

$$
C_b:=\sum_{\gamma=(P,N)\in\Gamma_b}\kappa(P,N)
$$

be the cylinder part of the $b$th score. Since the total affine-cylinder cost is $r_b$,

$$
C_b\leq r_b.
$$

Apply the cofactor interpolation lemma [105_affine_cylinder_cofactor_interpolation.md](105_affine_cylinder_cofactor_interpolation.md) with $S_0$ as the base score. Its affine indicator is at most $1$, and the number of changed affine slopes is at most $m$.

For every cylinder support $\gamma=(P,N)$,

$$
\kappa(P\cup\{z\},N)
=
\min\{2^{\lvert P\rvert+1},2^{\lvert N\rvert}\}
\leq
2\min\{2^{\lvert P\rvert},2^{\lvert N\rvert}\}
=
2\kappa(P,N).
$$

Thus the base cylinder contribution is at most $C_0$, and the changed-cylinder contribution is at most

$$
2(C_0+C_1),
$$

because every changed cylinder support lies in $\Gamma_0\cup\Gamma_1$. Therefore

$$
\operatorname{sactc}(f)
\leq
1+m+C_0+2(C_0+C_1)
=
1+m+3C_0+2C_1
\leq
1+m+3r_0+2r_1.
$$

This proves the displayed bound with base cofactor $0$.

To use the cylinder part of cofactor $1$ as the base instead, use the same interpolated score

$$
S(z,y)=(1-z)S_0(y)+zS_1(y),
$$

but rewrite its affine part as

$$
A_0(y)+z(A_1(y)-A_0(y)).
$$

The affine indicator is again at most $1$, and the changed affine slopes again contribute at most $m$ pure positive cylinders $zy_i$.

For the cylinder part, rewrite

$$
(1-z)V_0(y)+zV_1(y)
=
V_1(y)+(1-z)(V_0(y)-V_1(y)),
$$

where

$$
V_b(y):=\sum_{\gamma\in\Gamma_b}c_{b,\gamma}C_{\gamma}(y).
$$

The base cylinder contribution is now at most $C_1$. A lifted changed cylinder has the form

$$
(1-z)C_{P,N}(y)=C_{P,N\cup\{z\}}(z,y),
$$

and

$$
\kappa(P,N\cup\{z\})
=
\min\{2^{\lvert P\rvert},2^{\lvert N\rvert+1}\}
\leq
2\kappa(P,N).
$$

Therefore the same argument gives

$$
\operatorname{sactc}(f)
\leq
1+m+C_1+2(C_0+C_1)
=
1+m+2C_0+3C_1
\leq
1+m+2r_0+3r_1.
$$

Taking the smaller of the two estimates gives

$$
\operatorname{sactc}(f)
\leq
1+m+2(r_0+r_1)+\min\{r_0,r_1\}.
$$

Finally, [106_split_affine_cylinder_cost.md](106_split_affine_cylinder_cost.md) gives

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
\operatorname{actc}(f)
\leq
\operatorname{sactc}(f),
$$

which completes the chain. $\blacksquare$

## Consequences

If both cofactors have bounded affine-cylinder cost, then $f$ has bounded head complexity with only a linear-in-$m$ switching overhead:

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
1+m+2(r_0+r_1)+\min\{r_0,r_1\}.
$$

This is not intended to be tight for parity, where the exact recursion costs one head per fresh XOR bit. Its use is as a safe fallback when two cofactors have good affine-cylinder certificates but do not share enough structure for the sharper split interpolation lemmas to apply.
