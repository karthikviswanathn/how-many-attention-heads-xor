# Halfspace Intersections Force Many Heads

## Statement

There are an absolute constant $c>0$ and an infinite family of pairs of linear threshold functions

$$
T_n,U_n:\{0,1\}^{n}\to\{0,1\}
$$

such that, for

$$
F_n(x):=T_n(x)\wedge U_n(x),
$$

one has

$$
H^{*}(F_n)\geq c n.
$$

> **Interpretation.** Even the intersection of two halfspaces can require linearly many attention heads. The obstruction is not Boolean formula size, but threshold degree.

## Proof

Sherstov's optimal halfspace-intersection theorem [Optimal bounds for sign-representing the intersection of two halfspaces by polynomials](https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.4224) gives an absolute constant $c>0$ and an infinite family of pairs of halfspaces

$$
T_n,U_n:\{0,1\}^{n}\to\{0,1\}
$$

such that

$$
\deg_{\pm}(T_n\wedge U_n)\geq c n.
$$

Apply the threshold-degree lower bound [006_threshold_degree_head_complexity_bound.md](../01_foundations_and_normal_form/006_threshold_degree_head_complexity_bound.md), which gives

$$
\deg_{\pm}(f)\leq H^{*}(f)
$$

for every Boolean function $f$. With $F_n=T_n\wedge U_n$, this yields

$$
H^{*}(F_n)
\geq
\deg_{\pm}(F_n)
\geq
c n.
$$

$\blacksquare$

## Consequences

This family is a sharp warning against treating linear threshold gates as raw attention-head features. Each $T_n$ and $U_n$ has head complexity one after thresholding, but their raw indicators cannot both be cheaply calibrated in a two-feature vote. Otherwise Lemma 95 would contradict the displayed threshold-degree lower bound.

The theorem also gives a clean lower-bound benchmark for future upper-bound invariants: any invariant that always upper-bounds $H^{*}$ must assign linear cost to at least some intersections of two halfspaces.
