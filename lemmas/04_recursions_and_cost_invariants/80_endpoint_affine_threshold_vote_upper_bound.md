# Endpoint Affine-Threshold Vote Upper Bound

## Statement

For a nonempty set $S\subseteq\{1,\ldots,n\}$ and positive weights $\lambda_i>0$, define

$$
L_S(x):=\sum_{i\in S}\lambda_i x_i,
\qquad
\Lambda_S:=\sum_{i\in S}\lambda_i.
$$

An endpoint affine-threshold feature is either

$$
U_S(x):=\mathbf{1}[L_S(x)>0]
$$

or

$$
A_S(x):=\mathbf{1}[L_S(x)=\Lambda_S].
$$

Let $T_1,\ldots,T_s$ be endpoint affine-threshold features, and suppose

$$
f(x)=1
\qquad\Longleftrightarrow\qquad
c_0+\sum_{j=1}^{s}c_jT_j(x)>0
$$

with positive vote margin

$$
\mu
:=
\min_{x\in\{0,1\}^{n}}
\left\lvert
c_0+\sum_{j=1}^{s}c_jT_j(x)
\right\rvert
>
0.
$$

Then

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq s.
$$

> **Interpretation.** The unqualified threshold-vote upper bound fails for arbitrary LTF gates, but it is valid for strict votes over endpoint positive affine thresholds. This includes weighted votes over positive OR-type clauses and positive AND-type terms.

## Proof

By the calibrated threshold-vote theorem [79_calibrated_threshold_vote_upper_bound.md](79_calibrated_threshold_vote_upper_bound.md), it suffices to show that each endpoint feature can be uniformly approximated by a single one-head atom with arbitrarily small error.

Fix $S$ and write

$$
\lambda_{\min}:=\min_{i\in S}\lambda_i>0.
$$

### Lower endpoint

First consider

$$
U_S(x)=\mathbf{1}[L_S(x)>0].
$$

Choose small parameters $\delta>0$ and $\kappa>0$, and define

$$
B_U(x)
:=
\delta+L_S(x)+\kappa\sum_{i\notin S}x_i.
$$

This affine denominator has positive constant term and strictly positive coefficients for every variable after taking the coefficient $\kappa$ outside $S$. By the denominator-orientation theorem [26_denominator_orientation.md](../02_complexity_measure_upper_bounds/26_denominator_orientation.md),

$$
\phi_U(x):=\frac{L_S(x)}{B_U(x)}
$$

is a one-head atom.

If $U_S(x)=0$, then $L_S(x)=0$, so

$$
\phi_U(x)=0.
$$

If $U_S(x)=1$, then $L_S(x)\geq\lambda_{\min}$, and

$$
0
\leq
1-\phi_U(x)
=
\frac{\delta+\kappa\sum_{i\notin S}x_i}{B_U(x)}
\leq
\frac{\delta+\kappa n}{\lambda_{\min}}.
$$

Taking $\delta$ and $\kappa$ small enough makes this uniformly smaller than any prescribed tolerance.

### Upper endpoint

Now consider

$$
A_S(x)=\mathbf{1}[L_S(x)=\Lambda_S].
$$

Let

$$
D_S(x):=\Lambda_S-L_S(x).
$$

Thus $D_S(x)=0$ exactly on the upper endpoint, and $D_S(x)\geq\lambda_{\min}$ otherwise.

Choose small parameters $\delta>0$ and $\kappa>0$, and define

$$
B_A(x)
:=
\delta+D_S(x)+\kappa\sum_{i\notin S}(1-x_i).
$$

Equivalently,

$$
B_A(x)
=
\delta+\Lambda_S+\kappa(n-\lvert S\rvert)
-\sum_{i\in S}\lambda_i x_i
-\kappa\sum_{i\notin S}x_i.
$$

This affine denominator has strictly negative coefficients for every variable and remains positive on the cube. By the denominator-orientation theorem,

$$
\phi_A(x):=\frac{\delta}{B_A(x)}
$$

is a one-head atom.

If $A_S(x)=1$, then $D_S(x)=0$, so

$$
\phi_A(x)
=
\frac{\delta}{\delta+\kappa\sum_{i\notin S}(1-x_i)}.
$$

Choosing $\kappa$ much smaller than $\delta$ makes this uniformly as close to $1$ as desired.

If $A_S(x)=0$, then $D_S(x)\geq\lambda_{\min}$, so

$$
0
\leq
\phi_A(x)
\leq
\frac{\delta}{\delta+\lambda_{\min}}.
$$

Choosing $\delta$ small makes this uniformly as close to $0$ as desired.

Therefore both endpoint feature types admit arbitrarily accurate one-head atom approximations.

Finally, choose for each feature $T_j$ an approximation error $\epsilon_j$ so small that

$$
\sum_{j=1}^{s}\lvert c_j\rvert\epsilon_j<\mu.
$$

The calibrated threshold-vote theorem then gives

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq s.
$$

$\blacksquare$

## Consequences

Every strict weighted vote of positive monotone conjunctions and positive monotone disjunctions has head complexity at most the number of voted features.

This recovers the one-head-per-term monotone DNF and CNF upper bounds as special cases, but it also allows arbitrary real outer weights and mixed votes of lower-endpoint and upper-endpoint features.
