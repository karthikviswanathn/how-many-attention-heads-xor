# LTF Raw Calibration Has Linear Worst Case

## Statement

For each $n$, define

$$
R_{\mathrm{LTF}}(n)
:=
\max\lbrace\rho(T):T:\lbrace0,1\rbrace^{n}\to\lbrace0,1\rbrace\text{ is a nonconstant LTF}\rbrace.
$$

There is an absolute constant $c>0$ and infinitely many $n$ such that

$$
R_{\mathrm{LTF}}(n)\geq c n.
$$

Consequently, there are nonconstant linear threshold functions

$$
V_n:\lbrace0,1\rbrace^{n}\to\lbrace0,1\rbrace
$$

with

$$
H^{*}(V_n)=1
\qquad
\text{and}
\qquad
\rho(V_n)\geq c n.
$$

> **Interpretation.** Computing an LTF after the final threshold and raw-calibrating its $0/1$ indicator are different tasks. The gap can grow linearly.

## Proof

Use the halfspace-intersection family from [105_halfspace_intersection_head_lower_bound.md](105_halfspace_intersection_head_lower_bound.md). Thus, for infinitely many $n$, there are LTFs

$$
T_n,U_n:\lbrace0,1\rbrace^{n}\to\lbrace0,1\rbrace
$$

such that

$$
F_n(x):=T_n(x)\wedge U_n(x)
$$

satisfies

$$
H^{*}(F_n)\geq c_0 n
$$

for an absolute constant $c_0>0$.

On the other hand, $F_n$ is a strict weighted vote of the two Boolean features $T_n$ and $U_n$:

$$
F_n(x)=1
\qquad\Longleftrightarrow\qquad
T_n(x)+U_n(x)-\frac{3}{2}>0.
$$

Applying the raw-calibrated vote support bound [093_raw_calibrated_vote_support_bound.md](093_raw_calibrated_vote_support_bound.md) gives

$$
H^{*}(F_n)
\leq
\rho(T_n)+\rho(U_n).
$$

Therefore

$$
\rho(T_n)+\rho(U_n)\geq c_0 n.
$$

At least one of $T_n$ and $U_n$ has raw calibration cost at least $c_0n/2$. Let $V_n$ be such a choice. A constant Boolean feature has raw calibration cost $0$, because the definition of $\rho$ allows an added constant. Hence $V_n$ is nonconstant. Since $V_n$ is a nonconstant LTF, the one-head characterization gives

$$
H^{*}(V_n)=1.
$$

Taking $c=c_0/2$ proves both displayed claims. $\blacksquare$

## Consequences

There is no finite-valued function $g$ of the head count alone such that

$$
\rho(T)\leq g(H^{*}(T))
$$

for all Boolean functions $T$, even after restricting to LTFs. The left side is unbounded on functions with $H^{*}(T)=1$.

Thus raw calibration cost is a genuine additional parameter in calibrated threshold-vote and decision-list upper bounds. It is not controlled by the fact that an inner feature is itself one-head computable.
