# Cofactor Sparse-Polynomial Recursion

## Statement

Let

$$
f:\{0,1\}^{n}\to\{0,1\},
$$

and split off one coordinate, writing inputs as $(z,y)\in\{0,1\}\times\{0,1\}^{n-1}$. Let

$$
f_0(y):=f(0,y),
\qquad
f_1(y):=f(1,y).
$$

Suppose $P_0$ and $P_1$ strictly sign-represent $f_0$ and $f_1$. Let $\mathcal{A}_b$ be the set of nonconstant monomials appearing in $P_b$, and write

$$
m_b:=\lvert\mathcal{A}_b\rvert
\qquad
(b\in\{0,1\}).
$$

Then

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
m_0
+\lvert\mathcal{A}_0\cup\mathcal{A}_1\rvert
+1.
$$

In particular,

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
2m_0+m_1+1.
$$

Consequently, in terms of polynomial-threshold sparsity,

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
2\operatorname{ptfsp}(f_0)
+\operatorname{ptfsp}(f_1)
+1.
$$

Also, if both cofactors have threshold degree at most $d$, then

$$
\deg_{\pm}(f)\leq d+1.
$$

For nonconstant $f$, this gives the affine-free head bound

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
1+\sum_{r=2}^{\min\{d+1,n\}}\binom{n}{r}.
$$

> **Interpretation.** A clean one-head Shannon recursion remains open, but sparse sign polynomials do satisfy an explicit one-sided cofactor recursion. This gives a recursive route for structured functions whose cofactors have sparse sign representations.

## Proof

Let

$$
P_b(y)
=
c_b+\sum_{S\in\mathcal{A}_b}a_{b,S}\prod_{i\in S}y_i
\qquad
(b\in\{0,1\})
$$

strictly sign-represent $f_b$. Define

$$
P(z,y):=(1-z)P_0(y)+zP_1(y).
$$

If $z=0$, then $P(z,y)=P_0(y)$, and if $z=1$, then $P(z,y)=P_1(y)$. Hence

$$
f(z,y)=1
\qquad\Longleftrightarrow\qquad
P(z,y)>0.
$$

Thus $P$ sign-represents $f$.

Expanding,

$$
P(z,y)
=
P_0(y)+z\bigl(P_1(y)-P_0(y)\bigr).
$$

The nonconstant monomials not involving $z$ are contained in $\mathcal{A}_0$. The monomials involving $z$ are $z$ times the monomials appearing in $P_1-P_0$. These are contained in:

- the singleton monomial $z$, coming from the constant term $c_1-c_0$,
- the monomials $z\prod_{i\in S}y_i$ for $S\in\mathcal{A}_0\cup\mathcal{A}_1$.

Therefore this construction gives a sign polynomial for $f$ with at most

$$
m_0+\lvert\mathcal{A}_0\cup\mathcal{A}_1\rvert+1
$$

nonconstant monomials.

Applying the polynomial-threshold sparsity theorem [35_ptf_sparsity_upper_bound.md](../02_complexity_measure_upper_bounds/35_ptf_sparsity_upper_bound.md) proves

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
m_0
+\lvert\mathcal{A}_0\cup\mathcal{A}_1\rvert
+1.
$$

Since

$$
\lvert\mathcal{A}_0\cup\mathcal{A}_1\rvert
\leq
m_0+m_1,
$$

the displayed coarser bound follows. Minimizing over sparse sign representations of the two cofactors and using the coarser support bound proves the $\operatorname{ptfsp}$ corollary.

Finally, if $P_0$ and $P_1$ have degree at most $d$, then

$$
P(z,y)=(1-z)P_0(y)+zP_1(y)
$$

has degree at most $d+1$. Hence

$$
\deg_{\pm}(f)\leq d+1.
$$

If $f$ is nonconstant, the affine-free sparsity corollary [42_affine_free_sparsity_upper_bound.md](../03_function_families_and_affine_geometry/42_affine_free_sparsity_upper_bound.md) gives

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
1+\sum_{r=2}^{\min\{d+1,n\}}\binom{n}{r}.
$$

$\blacksquare$

## Consequences

This theorem gives a provable recursive replacement for the currently open one-head cofactor recursion:

$$
H^{*}(f)
\stackrel{?}{\leq}
\max\{H^{*}(f_0),H^{*}(f_1)\}+1.
$$

The open recursion would compose head representations directly. The proved recursion composes sparse sign polynomials instead, then routes them through the sparse-PTF upper bound.

For a decision tree, iterating this construction recovers the fact that a depth-$d$ tree has threshold degree at most $d$. For formulas and branching programs with sparse cofactor sign polynomials, the support-count version can be sharper than using degree alone.
