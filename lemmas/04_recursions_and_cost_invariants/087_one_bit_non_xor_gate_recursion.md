# One-Bit Non-XOR Gate Recursion

## Statement

Let

$$
T : \lbrace0,1\rbrace^{m}\to\lbrace0,1\rbrace
$$

be any Boolean function, and let

$$
G : \lbrace0,1\rbrace^{2}\to\lbrace0,1\rbrace
$$

be a two-input Boolean gate that is neither XOR nor XNOR. Define

$$
F(z,y):=G(z,T(y)).
$$

Then

$$
H^{*}(F)\leq H^{*}(T)+1.
$$

In particular,

$$
H^{*}(z\wedge T(y))\leq H^{*}(T)+1,
\qquad
H^{*}(z\vee T(y))\leq H^{*}(T)+1,
$$

and the same bound holds after complementing either input literal or the output.

> **Interpretation.** One fresh raw bit can be combined with an arbitrary previously computed feature through any non-XOR two-input gate at the cost of one additional head. The XOR and XNOR gates remain the exceptional recursive cases.

## Proof

If $T$ is constant, then $F$ is either constant or a one-bit function of $z$. Hence $H^{*}(F)\leq1=H^{*}(T)+1$. Assume from now on that $T$ is nonconstant.

Let $H:=H^{*}(T)$. By the linear-fractional normal form [010_linear_fractional_normal_form.md](../01_foundations_and_normal_form/010_linear_fractional_normal_form.md), there is an $H$-atom score

$$ S(y) = c+\sum_{h=1}^{H}\phi_h(y) $$

such that

$$
T(y)=1
\qquad\Longleftrightarrow\qquad
S(y)>0.
$$

By complement invariance [028_restrictions_and_sign_rank.md](../02_complexity_measure_upper_bounds/028_restrictions_and_sign_rank.md), the same head count also sign-represents $1-T$, using the score $-S$.

Every two-input Boolean gate that is neither XOR nor XNOR is, up to constants, input literals, and output complement, either a conjunction of two literals or a disjunction of two literals. Constant gates and input-literal gates have head complexity at most $\max\lbrace H,1\rbrace\leq H+1$. Thus it is enough to handle

$$
r(z)\wedge U(y)
\qquad
\text{and}
\qquad
r(z)\vee U(y),
$$

where $r(z)$ is either $z$ or $1-z$, and $U$ is either $T$ or $1-T$.

Choose a score $S_U(y)$ with $H$ atoms such that

$$
U(y)=1
\qquad\Longleftrightarrow\qquad
S_U(y)>0.
$$

The dummy-variable construction from [028_restrictions_and_sign_rank.md](../02_complexity_measure_upper_bounds/028_restrictions_and_sign_rank.md) gives the following stronger fact: for every $\eta>0$, the same $H$ atoms can be realized on the enlarged input $(z,y)$ with a score $S_{U,\eta}(z,y)$ satisfying

$$
\lvert S_{U,\eta}(z,y)-S_U(y)\rvert<\eta
\qquad
\text{for all }(z,y).
$$

The raw literal $r(z)$ also admits arbitrarily accurate one-head atom approximations on the enlarged cube. For $r(z)=z$, use

$$
\psi_{z,\eta}(z,y)
:=
\frac{z}{\delta+z+\kappa\sum_i y_i}.
$$

For $r(z)=1-z$, use

$$
\psi_{\bar z,\eta}(z,y)
:=
\frac{1-z}{\delta+1-z+\kappa\sum_i(1-y_i)}.
$$

The denominators have a common orientation and stay positive on the cube, so the denominator-orientation theorem [032_denominator_orientation.md](../02_complexity_measure_upper_bounds/032_denominator_orientation.md) makes these one-head atoms. Taking $\delta$ and $\kappa$ small makes the chosen atom $\psi_{r,\eta}$ uniformly $\eta$-close to $r$.

### Conjunction

Let

$$
M:=\max_{y}S_U(y).
$$

Since $U$ is nonconstant, $M>0$. Pick $A>0$ and $B>A M$. Consider the ideal score

$$
R_{\wedge}(z,y):=A S_U(y)+B r(z)-B.
$$

If $r(z)=1$, then

$$
R_{\wedge}(z,y)=A S_U(y),
$$

so its sign is the sign of $U(y)$. If $r(z)=0$, then

$$
R_{\wedge}(z,y)=A S_U(y)-B\leq A M-B<0.
$$

Thus $R_{\wedge}$ sign-represents $r\wedge U$ with a positive finite margin $\Delta_{\wedge}$. Choose approximation errors for $S_U$ and $r$ so that

$$
A\lvert S_{U,\eta}(z,y)-S_U(y)\rvert
+B\lvert \psi_{r,\eta}(z,y)-r(z)\rvert
<
\frac{\Delta_{\wedge}}{2}
$$

for every $(z,y)$. Then

$$
A S_{U,\eta}(z,y)+B\psi_{r,\eta}(z,y)-B
$$

has the same sign as $R_{\wedge}$ everywhere. This uses the $H$ approximate dummy-extended atoms for $U$ and one additional atom for $r$.

Therefore

$$
H^{*}(r\wedge U)\leq H+1.
$$

### Disjunction

Let

$$
m:=\min_{y}S_U(y).
$$

Since $U$ is nonconstant, $m<0$. Pick $A>0$ and $B>A(-m)$. Consider

$$
R_{\vee}(z,y):=A S_U(y)+B r(z).
$$

If $r(z)=0$, then $R_{\vee}(z,y)=A S_U(y)$, so its sign is the sign of $U(y)$. If $r(z)=1$, then

$$
R_{\vee}(z,y)\geq A m+B>0.
$$

Thus $R_{\vee}$ sign-represents $r\vee U$ with positive finite margin $\Delta_{\vee}$. Again choose the approximation errors for $S_U$ and $r$ small enough that

$$
A\lvert S_{U,\eta}(z,y)-S_U(y)\rvert
+B\lvert \psi_{r,\eta}(z,y)-r(z)\rvert
<
\frac{\Delta_{\vee}}{2}
$$

everywhere. Then

$$
A S_{U,\eta}(z,y)+B\psi_{r,\eta}(z,y)
$$

has the same sign as $R_{\vee}$ everywhere. This gives an $(H+1)$-head representation of $r\vee U$.

The conjunction and disjunction cases cover all non-XOR gates after the literal and complement reductions above. Hence

$$
H^{*}(F)\leq H^{*}(T)+1.
$$

$\blacksquare$

## Consequences

The cofactor-recursion target is settled for one of its two simplest feature-dependent cases:

$$
H^{*}(z\wedge T)\leq H^{*}(T)+1.
$$

The same proof handles $z\vee T$, implications, reverse implications, NAND, NOR, and all literal variants.

Combined with the one-bit gate threshold-degree trichotomy, this isolates XOR and XNOR as the only one-bit gates that both raise threshold degree and remain outside the proved $H^{*}(T)+1$ recursion theorem.
