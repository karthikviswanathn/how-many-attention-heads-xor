# Subcube Raw Calibration Cost

## Statement

Let $(P,N)$ be a partial assignment, where $P,N\subseteq\{1,\ldots,n\}$ are disjoint. Define its subcube indicator

$$
C_{P,N}(x)
:=
\left(\prod_{i\in P}x_i\right)
\left(\prod_{j\in N}(1-x_j)\right).
$$

If $P=N=\varnothing$, then

$$
\rho(C_{P,N})=0.
$$

Otherwise,

$$
\rho(C_{P,N})
\leq
\min\{2^{\lvert P\rvert},2^{\lvert N\rvert}\}.
$$

> **Interpretation.** A single cylinder test has low raw calibration cost when it fixes few coordinates of at least one sign. This is the raw-feature version of local certificate expansion.

## Proof

If $P=N=\varnothing$, then $C_{P,N}=1$, and the constant term allowed in the definition of $\rho$ gives $\rho(C_{P,N})=0$.

Assume now that $(P,N)$ is nonvacuous. The local certificate-expansion lemma [044_oriented_certificate_expansion_upper_bound.md](../02_complexity_measure_upper_bounds/044_oriented_certificate_expansion_upper_bound.md) records two exact expansions. Expanding the negative literals gives

$$
\begin{aligned}
C_{P,N}(x)
&=
\left(\prod_{i\in P}x_i\right)
\left(\prod_{j\in N}(1-x_j)\right) \\
&=
\sum_{U\subseteq N}
(-1)^{\lvert U\rvert}
\prod_{i\in P\cup U}x_i.
\end{aligned}
$$

This expansion has at most $2^{\lvert N\rvert}$ terms, each a signed pure positive monomial, with any empty monomial absorbed into the free constant.

Expanding the positive literals instead gives

$$
\begin{aligned}
C_{P,N}(x)
&=
\left(\prod_{i\in P}x_i\right)
\left(\prod_{j\in N}(1-x_j)\right) \\
&=
\sum_{U\subseteq P}
(-1)^{\lvert U\rvert}
\prod_{j\in N\cup U}(1-x_j).
\end{aligned}
$$

This expansion has at most $2^{\lvert P\rvert}$ terms, each a signed pure negative monomial, again with any empty monomial absorbed into the free constant.

Choose the cheaper expansion and let $\mathcal{M}$ be the set of its nonconstant signed pure monomial terms. Then

$$
\lvert\mathcal{M}\rvert
\leq
\min\{2^{\lvert P\rvert},2^{\lvert N\rvert}\}.
$$

The proof of [044_oriented_certificate_expansion_upper_bound.md](../02_complexity_measure_upper_bounds/044_oriented_certificate_expansion_upper_bound.md), using [041_ptf_sparsity_upper_bound.md](../02_complexity_measure_upper_bounds/041_ptf_sparsity_upper_bound.md) and bit-flip invariance from [028_restrictions_and_sign_rank.md](../02_complexity_measure_upper_bounds/028_restrictions_and_sign_rank.md), shows that every signed pure positive or signed pure negative monomial can be approximated uniformly to arbitrary accuracy by one head.

Given $\epsilon>0$, approximate each term in $\mathcal{M}$ with uniform error at most $\epsilon/\max\{1,\lvert\mathcal{M}\rvert\}$, and keep the constant part exactly. The sum of these one-head atoms and the constant term approximates $C_{P,N}$ uniformly within $\epsilon$. Hence

$$
\rho(C_{P,N})
\leq
\lvert\mathcal{M}\rvert
\leq
\min\{2^{\lvert P\rvert},2^{\lvert N\rvert}\}.
$$

$\blacksquare$

## Consequences

If a strict weighted vote uses subcube indicators $C_{P_j,N_j}$ as features, then Lemma 93 gives

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
\sum_{j:c_j\neq0}
\min\{2^{\lvert P_j\rvert},2^{\lvert N_j\rvert}\}.
$$

If a decision list tests subcube indicators, Lemma 94 gives the same summed local expansion cost over the tested cylinders. Thus the local certificate-expansion theorem can be reused inside arbitrary strict votes and decision lists, not only as a one-sided cover of a label class.
