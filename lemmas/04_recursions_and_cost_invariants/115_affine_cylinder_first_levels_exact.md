# Affine-Cylinder First Levels Are Exact

## Statement

For every Boolean function $f$,

$$
\mathrm{actc}(f)=0
\qquad\Longleftrightarrow\qquad
f \text{ is constant},
$$

and

$$
\mathrm{actc}(f)=1
\qquad\Longleftrightarrow\qquad
f \text{ is a nonconstant LTF}.
$$

Equivalently,

$$
\mathrm{actc}(f)\geq2
\qquad\Longleftrightarrow\qquad
f \text{ is neither constant nor a nonconstant LTF}.
$$

> **Interpretation.** The affine-cylinder cost has the same first two levels as head complexity. Its first possible slack over $H^{*}$ can only begin at level $2$.

## Proof

If $\mathrm{actc}(f)=0$, then the affine-cylinder representation has no nonconstant affine part and no nonvacuous cylinder terms. The score is constant on the cube, so $f$ is constant.

Conversely, if $f$ is constant, choose a constant strict score, positive for the constant $1$ function and negative for the constant $0$ function. This has affine-cylinder cost $0$, so

$$
\mathrm{actc}(f)=0.
$$

Now suppose $f$ is a nonconstant LTF. Choose a strict affine separator

$$
A(x)=a_0+\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i x_i
$$

for $f$. Since $f$ is nonconstant, some linear coefficient is nonzero. Thus $\lambda(A)=1$, and the affine score alone gives

$$
\mathrm{actc}(f)\leq1.
$$

The function is not constant, so the first part rules out $\mathrm{actc}(f)=0$. Hence

$$
\mathrm{actc}(f)=1.
$$

Conversely, suppose $\mathrm{actc}(f)=1$. The head upper bound [103_affine_cylinder_threshold_cost.md](103_affine_cylinder_threshold_cost.md) gives

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq1.
$$

The zero-head and one-head characterization [011_one_head_characterization.md](../01_foundations_and_normal_form/011_one_head_characterization.md) says that functions with $H^{*}\leq1$ are exactly constants and nonconstant LTFs. Since $\mathrm{actc}(f)\neq0$, the first part shows that $f$ is not constant. Therefore $f$ is a nonconstant LTF.

Finally, the displayed lower-level characterization implies

$$
\mathrm{actc}(f)\leq1
\qquad\Longleftrightarrow\qquad
f \text{ is constant or a nonconstant LTF}.
$$

Taking the negation gives the final equivalence. $\blacksquare$

## Consequences

The low-cost exactness theorem [109_low_affine_cylinder_cost_exactness.md](109_low_affine_cylinder_cost_exactness.md) starts with a sharp base:

$$
\mathrm{actc}(f)
=
H^{*}(f)
\qquad
\text{for }
\mathrm{actc}(f)\in\lbrace0,1\rbrace.
$$

Thus any affine-cylinder certificate for a function that is neither constant nor a nonconstant LTF must pay cost at least $2$, and cost $2$ is automatically an exact two-head certificate.
