# Affine-Cylinder Threshold Cost

## Statement

For a partial assignment $(P,N)$ with disjoint $P,N\subseteq\lbrace1,\ldots,n\rbrace$, define

$$
C_{P,N}(x)
:=
\left(\prod_{i\in P}x_i\right)
\left(\prod_{j\in N}(1-x_j)\right)
$$

and

$$
\kappa(P,N)
:=
\begin{cases}
0, & P=N=\varnothing, \\
\min\lbrace2^{\lvert P\rvert},2^{\lvert N\rvert}\rbrace, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$

For an affine form

$$
A(x)=a_{\varnothing}+\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i x_i,
$$

define

$$
\lambda(A)
:=
\mathbf{1} \left[
\exists i,\ a_i\neq0
\right].
$$

Define the affine-cylinder threshold cost $\mathrm{actc}(f)$ to be the minimum of

$$
\lambda(A)+\sum_{a:c_a\neq0}\kappa(P_a,N_a)
$$

over all strict representations

$$
f(x)=1
\qquad\Longleftrightarrow\qquad
A(x)+\sum_{a=1}^{s}c_aC_{P_a,N_a}(x)>0.
$$

Then

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq\mathrm{actc}(f).
$$

Moreover,

$$
\mathrm{actc}(f)\leq\mathrm{ctc}(f),
$$

so $\mathrm{actc}(f)$ is finite for every Boolean function.

> **Interpretation.** A strict cylinder-threshold representation should not pay separately for every linear monomial. The affine-cylinder cost keeps the signed cylinder-vote flexibility of $\mathrm{ctc}$ while letting one head approximate the whole affine part.

## Proof

First note that the feasible set is nonempty. The singleton-cylinder representation used in [099_cylinder_threshold_cost_invariant.md](099_cylinder_threshold_cost_invariant.md) is an affine-cylinder representation with affine part $A=0$. Thus the set of feasible integer costs is a nonempty subset of the nonnegative integers, so it has a least element.

Fix a strict affine-cylinder representation

$$
f(x)=1
\qquad\Longleftrightarrow\qquad
V(x)>0,
\qquad
V(x):=
A(x)+\sum_{a=1}^{s}c_aC_{P_a,N_a}(x).
$$

Since $V$ is strict on the finite cube, its margin

$$
\Delta
:=
\min_{x\in\lbrace0,1\rbrace^n}\lvert V(x)\rvert
$$

is positive.

Let

$$
\mathcal{J}
:=
\lbrace a:c_a\neq0,\ \kappa(P_a,N_a)>0\rbrace.
$$

Vacuous cylinders have $\kappa(P_a,N_a)=0$ and are constants, so they can be kept exactly in the final readout bias.

Choose positive tolerances so that the total weighted error is below the margin:

$$
\epsilon_A
+
\sum_{a\in\mathcal{J}}\lvert c_a\rvert\epsilon_a
<
\Delta,
$$

where the $\epsilon_A$ term is used only when $\lambda(A)=1$.

If $\lambda(A)=1$, Lemma 1 of [048_affine_free_sparsity_upper_bound.md](../03_function_families_and_affine_geometry/048_affine_free_sparsity_upper_bound.md) gives one head atom $\psi_A$ such that

$$
\lvert\psi_A(x)-A(x)\rvert<\epsilon_A
\qquad
\text{for every }x.
$$

If $\lambda(A)=0$, then $A$ is constant and is kept exactly in the final readout bias, using no head.

For each $a\in\mathcal{J}$, the subcube raw calibration lemma [096_subcube_raw_calibration_cost.md](096_subcube_raw_calibration_cost.md) gives a constant $b_{a,0}$ and at most $\kappa(P_a,N_a)$ one-head atoms $\phi_{a,h}$ such that

$$ \left\lvert b_{a,0} + \sum_{h=1}^{\kappa(P_a,N_a)}\phi_{a,h}(x) - C_{P_a,N_a}(x) \right\rvert < \epsilon_a \qquad \text{for every }x. $$

Let $\widetilde V$ be the resulting approximation to $V$: use $\psi_A$ for the affine part when $\lambda(A)=1$, keep all constant pieces in the readout bias, and replace each nonvacuous cylinder by its raw calibrated approximation. Then for every cube point,

$$
\lvert\widetilde V(x)-V(x)\rvert
<
\Delta.
$$

Therefore $\widetilde V$ has the same sign as $V$ on the cube. Scalar multiples of one-head atoms are still one-head atoms by scaling numerator parameters. Hence the linear-fractional normal form [010_linear_fractional_normal_form.md](../01_foundations_and_normal_form/010_linear_fractional_normal_form.md) gives

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
\lambda(A)+\sum_{a:c_a\neq0}\kappa(P_a,N_a).
$$

Taking the minimum over strict affine-cylinder representations proves

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq\mathrm{actc}(f).
$$

Finally, every strict cylinder-threshold representation

$$
f(x)=1
\qquad\Longleftrightarrow\qquad
c_0+\sum_{a=1}^{s}c_aC_{P_a,N_a}(x)>0
$$

is an affine-cylinder representation by taking $A(x)=c_0$. Since $\lambda(A)=0$ for a constant affine form, the same representation has the same cost. Minimizing gives

$$
\mathrm{actc}(f)\leq\mathrm{ctc}(f).
$$

The finiteness of $\mathrm{actc}(f)$ follows from the finiteness of $\mathrm{ctc}(f)$ in Lemma 99. $\blacksquare$

## Consequences

The invariant $\mathrm{actc}$ is a strict optimization target between the linear-fractional normal form and older certificate classes. It inherits every feasible cylinder-threshold certificate, but it also treats dense affine thresholds as one-head primitives.

In particular, a representation with many linear monomials and a few locally cheap cylinders can have small $\mathrm{actc}$ even when the same score has large ordinary cylinder cost or large ordinary monomial sparsity.
