# Affine-Free Cofactor Recursion

## Statement

Let

$$
f:\{0,1\}^{n}\to\{0,1\},
$$

and split off one coordinate, writing inputs as $(z,y)\in\{0,1\}\times\{0,1\}^{n-1}$. Let

$$
f_0(y):=f(0,y),
\qquad
f_1(y):=f(1,y).
$$

Suppose $P_0$ and $P_1$ strictly sign-represent $f_0$ and $f_1$, and write

$$
P_b(y)
=
c_b+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\alpha_{b,i}y_i
+\sum_{\substack{S\subseteq\{1,\ldots,n-1\}\\ \lvert S\rvert\geq2}}
a_{b,S}\prod_{i\in S}y_i
\qquad
(b\in\{0,1\}).
$$

Let

$$
\mathcal{N}_b
:=
\left\{
S\subseteq\{1,\ldots,n-1\}:
\lvert S\rvert\geq2,\ a_{b,S}\neq0
\right\},
$$

and let

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\Delta}
:=
\left\{
i\in\{1,\ldots,n-1\}:
\alpha_{1,i}\neq\alpha_{0,i}
\right\}.
$$

Then

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
1
+\lvert\mathcal{N}_0\rvert
+\lvert\mathcal{N}_0\cup\mathcal{N}_1\rvert
+\lvert\mathcal{L}_{\Delta}\rvert.
$$

Consequently, if both cofactors have threshold degree at most $d$, then

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
1+(n-1)
+2\sum_{r=2}^{\min\{d,n-1\}}\binom{n-1}{r}.
$$

In particular, if both cofactors are constants or linear threshold functions, then

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq n.
$$

Finally, if $f_0$ and $f_1$ have affine sign representations whose linear coefficient vectors differ in at most one coordinate, then

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq2.
$$

In that last case, the exact value is $0$, $1$, or $2$ according as $f$ is constant, a nonconstant linear threshold function, or neither.

> **Interpretation.** The sparse cofactor recursion can overpay for linear terms. Affine-free sparsity bundles all affine terms into one head and only pays separately for genuine nonlinear cofactor monomials and for slope changes across the split.

## Proof

Define

$$
P(z,y):=(1-z)P_0(y)+zP_1(y).
$$

As in the sparse cofactor recursion, $P$ strictly sign-represents $f$, because $P(0,y)=P_0(y)$ and $P(1,y)=P_1(y)$.

Expanding,

$$
P(z,y)
=
P_0(y)+z\bigl(P_1(y)-P_0(y)\bigr).
$$

The affine part of $P$ includes the constant term, the linear terms in $y$ from $P_0$, and the possible singleton term $z(c_1-c_0)$. All of these cost at most one affine head under the affine-free sparsity theorem [42_affine_free_sparsity_upper_bound.md](42_affine_free_sparsity_upper_bound.md).

The genuinely nonlinear monomials of $P$ are contained in three groups.

1. The nonlinear monomials from $P_0$, namely

$$
\prod_{i\in S}y_i
\qquad
(S\in\mathcal{N}_0).
$$

2. The mixed quadratic monomials coming from changed linear coefficients:

$$
z y_i
\qquad
(i\in\mathcal{L}_{\Delta}).
$$

3. The mixed monomials coming from nonlinear cofactor differences:

$$
z\prod_{i\in S}y_i
\qquad
(S\in\mathcal{N}_0\cup\mathcal{N}_1).
$$

Therefore

$$
\operatorname{afs}(P)
\leq
1
+\lvert\mathcal{N}_0\rvert
+\lvert\mathcal{L}_{\Delta}\rvert
+\lvert\mathcal{N}_0\cup\mathcal{N}_1\rvert.
$$

Applying the affine-free sparsity theorem gives the same upper bound for $H^{*}(f)$:

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
1
+\lvert\mathcal{N}_0\rvert
+\lvert\mathcal{N}_0\cup\mathcal{N}_1\rvert
+\lvert\mathcal{L}_{\Delta}\rvert.
$$

For the threshold-degree corollary, choose degree-at-most-$d$ sign polynomials for both cofactors. Then

$$
\lvert\mathcal{N}_b\rvert
\leq
\sum_{r=2}^{\min\{d,n-1\}}\binom{n-1}{r}
\qquad
(b\in\{0,1\}),
$$

and

$$
\lvert\mathcal{L}_{\Delta}\rvert\leq n-1.
$$

Substituting these bounds proves

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
1+(n-1)
+2\sum_{r=2}^{\min\{d,n-1\}}\binom{n-1}{r}.
$$

If both cofactors are constants or linear threshold functions, take $d=1$. The sum is empty, so

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq n.
$$

Finally, suppose $f_0$ and $f_1$ have affine sign representations whose linear coefficient vectors differ in at most one coordinate. Then

$$
\mathcal{N}_0=\mathcal{N}_1=\varnothing,
\qquad
\lvert\mathcal{L}_{\Delta}\rvert\leq1.
$$

The displayed bound gives $H^{*}(f)\leq2$. The exact $0$, $1$, or $2$ classification follows from the low affine-free support theorem [64_low_affine_free_support_exact.md](64_low_affine_free_support_exact.md). $\blacksquare$

## Consequences

This theorem gives a sharper recursion than the raw sparse-polynomial cofactor bound whenever the cofactor polynomials have many linear terms. In particular, a function whose two slices along one coordinate are LTFs always has a linear head bound:

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq n.
$$

The strongest exact corollary is the one-slope-change case. If the two affine slice separators differ in no slope coordinates, the glued polynomial is affine and $f$ is an LTF. If they differ in one slope coordinate, the glued polynomial is affine plus one quadratic monomial, so the low affine-free support classification gives the exact constant, one-head, or two-head split.
