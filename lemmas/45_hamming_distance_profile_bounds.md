# Hamming-Distance Profile Bounds

## Statement

Let $F:\{0,1,\ldots,m\}\to\{0,1\}$ and define the Hamming-distance profile function

$$
g_F(x,y)
:=
F\!\left(\Delta(x,y)\right),
\qquad
x,y\in\{0,1\}^m,
$$

where

$$
\Delta(x,y)
:=
\sum_{i=1}^{m}(x_i\oplus y_i)
=
\sum_{i=1}^{m}(x_i+y_i-2x_i y_i).
$$

Let $C(F)$ be the number of sign changes in the sequence

$$
F(0),F(1),\ldots,F(m).
$$

Define

$$
U_m(C)
:=
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } C=0,\\
1+m+\sum_{r=2}^{C}3^r\binom{m}{r} & \text{if } C\geq1.
\end{cases}
$$

Then

$$
C(F)
\leq
H^{*}(g_F)
\leq
U_m(C(F)).
$$

> **Interpretation.** Hamming-distance profiles have the same symmetric sign-change lower bound as ordinary symmetric functions, by restricting one string to zero. The upper bound is less efficient than the intersection-profile bound because each distance bit $x_i\oplus y_i$ expands into three monomials, but all linear terms still cost only one affine head.

## Proof

### Lemma 1. Symmetric restriction lower bound

Restrict

$$
y_1=\cdots=y_m=0.
$$

Then

$$
\Delta(x,0)=\sum_{i=1}^{m}x_i,
$$

and therefore

$$
g_F(x,0)
=
F\!\left(\sum_{i=1}^{m}x_i\right).
$$

This is the symmetric Boolean function with Hamming-weight label sequence

$$
F(0),F(1),\ldots,F(m).
$$

By the symmetric sign-change theorem [06_symmetric_sign_changes.md](06_symmetric_sign_changes.md), the restricted function has head complexity $C(F)$. Restriction monotonicity from [22_restrictions_and_sign_rank.md](22_restrictions_and_sign_rank.md) gives

$$
H^{*}(g_F)\geq C(F).
$$

### Lemma 2. A degree-$C(F)$ sign polynomial in distance

As in [44_intersection_profile_bounds.md](44_intersection_profile_bounds.md), define

$$
q_k:=
\begin{cases}
+1 & \text{if } F(k)=1,\\
-1 & \text{if } F(k)=0,
\end{cases}
$$

and

$$
\mathcal{J}:=\{j\in\{0,\ldots,m-1\}:q_j\neq q_{j+1}\}.
$$

Let

$$
R(t):=
q_0\prod_{j\in\mathcal{J}}\left(j+\frac{1}{2}-t\right).
$$

Then $R$ has degree $C(F)$ and satisfies

$$
q_kR(k)>0
$$

for every $k\in\{0,\ldots,m\}$.

Thus

$$
R(\Delta(x,y))
$$

sign-represents $g_F$.

### Lemma 3. Affine-free sparse expansion upper bound

Set

$$
z_i:=x_i\oplus y_i=x_i+y_i-2x_i y_i.
$$

If $C(F)=0$, then $F$ is constant and $g_F$ is constant, so $H^{*}(g_F)=0$.

Assume $C(F)\geq1$. By Lemma 2, $R(z_1+\cdots+z_m)$ sign-represents $g_F$ and has degree at most $C(F)$ in the variables $z_i$. After reducing modulo $z_i^2=z_i$, it is a linear combination of products

$$
\prod_{i\in S}z_i
$$

with

$$
1\leq\lvert S\rvert\leq C(F).
$$

For $\lvert S\rvert=1$, the corresponding terms are scalar multiples of

$$
z_i=x_i+y_i-2x_i y_i.
$$

Across all $i$, the linear pieces $x_i$ and $y_i$ form one affine part, while the nonlinear pieces $x_i y_i$ contribute at most $m$ degree-two monomials.

For $\lvert S\rvert=r\geq2$, the product

$$
\prod_{i\in S}(x_i+y_i-2x_i y_i)
$$

expands into at most $3^r$ monomials in the original $2m$ Boolean variables, and every such monomial has degree at least $2$.

Therefore the affine-free support cost of this sign polynomial is at most

$$
1+m+\sum_{r=2}^{C(F)}3^r\binom{m}{r}.
$$

Applying the affine-free polynomial-threshold sparsity upper bound [42_affine_free_sparsity_upper_bound.md](42_affine_free_sparsity_upper_bound.md) gives

$$
H^{*}(g_F)
\leq
1+m+\sum_{r=2}^{C(F)}3^r\binom{m}{r}
=
U_m(C(F)).
$$

Together with Lemma 1 and the constant case, this proves the theorem. $\blacksquare$

## Consequence

### Lemma 4. Hamming-distance thresholds

For $1\leq t\leq m$, define

$$
\mathrm{HDTH}_{m,t}(x,y)
:=
\mathbf{1}[\Delta(x,y)\geq t].
$$

Then

$$
H^{*}(\mathrm{HDTH}_{1,1})=2,
$$

and for $m\geq2$,

$$
2\leq H^{*}(\mathrm{HDTH}_{m,t})\leq m+1.
$$

**Proof.** The upper bound is the theorem with one sign change, so $U_m(1)=m+1$.

For the lower bound, fix the first $t-1$ pairs to be unequal, leave pair $t$ free, and fix all pairs after $t$ to be equal. Then $\mathrm{HDTH}_{m,t}$ restricts to

$$
x\oplus y
$$

on the free pair. Exact two-bit parity gives head complexity $2$, so restriction monotonicity gives the lower bound.

When $m=1$ and $t=1$, the function is exactly $\mathrm{XOR}_2$, so the exact parity theorem gives

$$
H^{*}(\mathrm{HDTH}_{1,1})=2.
$$

$\blacksquare$

### Lemma 5. Equality revisited

Equality is the endpoint Hamming-distance profile

$$
\mathrm{EQ}_m(x,y)=\mathbf{1}[\Delta(x,y)=0].
$$

Here $C(F)=1$, so the theorem gives

$$
H^{*}(\mathrm{EQ}_m)\leq m+1.
$$

The sharper equality bracket and threshold-degree statement are recorded in [43_equality_bounds.md](43_equality_bounds.md).
