# Positive-Projection Sign-Change Upper Bound

## Statement

Let $f : \lbrace0,1\rbrace^n \to \lbrace0,1\rbrace$.

Suppose there are positive weights

$$
\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n > 0
$$

and a function

$$
F : \mathrm{Im}(t) \to \lbrace0,1\rbrace,
$$

where

$$
t(x) := \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i x_i,
$$

such that

$$
f(x) = F(t(x))
$$

for every $x \in \lbrace0,1\rbrace^n$.

Write the image of $t$ in increasing order as

$$
0 = \tau_0 < \tau_1 < \cdots < \tau_{M-1}.
$$

Define signs

$$
\sigma_m
:=
\begin{cases}
+1 & \text{if } F(\tau_m) = 1, \\
-1 & \text{if } F(\tau_m) = 0,
\end{cases}
\qquad
0 \leq m \leq M-1.
$$

Let

$$
C_t(F)
:=
\lvert
\left\lbrace
m \in \lbrace1,\ldots,M-1\rbrace : \sigma_{m-1} \neq \sigma_m
\right\rbrace
\rvert.
$$

Then

$$
H^{*}(f) \leq C_t(F).
$$

Consequently, if

$$
C_{+}(f)
:=
\min C_t(F),
$$

where the minimum ranges over all positive weighted sums $t$ through which $f$ factors, then

$$
H^{*}(f) \leq C_{+}(f) \leq M_{+}(f) - 1.
$$

The quantity $C_{+}(f)$ is finite for every Boolean function, because the binary-weight projection

$$
t(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{i-1}x_i
$$

is injective on the Boolean cube.

> **Equivalently.** If a Boolean function becomes a one-dimensional labeled sequence after projection onto a positive weighted sum, then one head per label change along that sequence suffices.

## Proof

If $C_t(F) = 0$, then all labels on $\mathrm{Im}(t)$ are equal, so $f$ is constant and $H^{*}(f)=0$.

Assume

$$
C := C_t(F) \geq 1.
$$

### Lemma 1. A shifted reciprocal of t costs one head

Fix $r > 0$ and $d \in \mathbb{R}$. The scalar function

$$
\psi_{r,d}(x)
:=
\frac{d}{t(x)+r}
$$

is a one-head atom in the sense of [010_linear_fractional_normal_form.md](010_linear_fractional_normal_form.md).

**Proof.** Let

$$
\Lambda := \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i.
$$

Choose

$$
\alpha > 1 + \frac{\Lambda}{r}.
$$

Set

$$
\rho_i := \frac{\lambda_i}{\alpha - 1}
\qquad
\text{for } 1 \leq i \leq n,
$$

and

$$
\gamma := r - \frac{\Lambda}{\alpha - 1}.
$$

Then every $\rho_i$ is positive and $\gamma > 0$.

In the one-head atom definition, take

$$
\eta = d, \qquad m_i = 0, \qquad \delta = 0.
$$

Since $x_i \in \lbrace0,1\rbrace$,

$$
\alpha^{x_i} = 1 + (\alpha - 1)x_i.
$$

Therefore

$$
\begin{aligned}
\gamma + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \rho_i \alpha^{x_i}
&=
r - \frac{\Lambda}{\alpha - 1}
+ \sum_{i=1}^{n}
\frac{\lambda_i}{\alpha - 1}\left(1 + (\alpha - 1)x_i\right) \\
&=
r + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i x_i \\
&=
r+t(x).
\end{aligned}
$$

The numerator is the constant $d$. Hence the atom is exactly

$$
\frac{d}{t(x)+r}.
$$

$\blacksquare$

### Lemma 2. C heads realize the projected sign sequence

Let

$$
J := \lbrace m \in \lbrace1,\ldots,M-1\rbrace : \sigma_{m-1} \neq \sigma_m\rbrace.
$$

For every $m \in J$, choose a cut point

$$
a_m \in (\tau_{m-1},\tau_m).
$$

Define

$$
P(z) := \sigma_0 \prod_{m \in J} (a_m - z).
$$

Then $P$ has degree $C$ and

$$
\mathrm{sgn}(P(\tau_m)) = \sigma_m
\qquad
\text{for every } m \in \lbrace0,\ldots,M-1\rbrace.
$$

Now choose distinct positive numbers

$$
r_1,\ldots,r_C > 0
$$

and set

$$
B(z) := \prod_{j=1}^{C}(z+r_j).
$$

Because every $\tau_m$ is nonnegative, $B(\tau_m) > 0$. Therefore

$$
S(z) := \frac{P(z)}{B(z)}
$$

has the same sign as $P$ on $\mathrm{Im}(t)$.

Since $\deg P \leq C = \deg B$ and the roots $-r_j$ are distinct, the partial-fraction decomposition has the form

$$
S(z)
=
c + \sum_{j=1}^{C} \frac{d_j}{z+r_j}
$$

for some real coefficients

$$
c,d_1,\ldots,d_C \in \mathbb{R}.
$$

By Lemma 1, each function

$$
x \mapsto \frac{d_j}{t(x)+r_j}
$$

is a one-head atom. Therefore $C$ heads and constant offset $c$ realize the score

$$
c + \sum_{j=1}^{C} \frac{d_j}{t(x)+r_j}
=
S(t(x)).
$$

This score is positive exactly when $F(t(x)) = 1$, and negative exactly when $F(t(x)) = 0$. Hence

$$
H^{*}(f) \leq C_t(F).
$$

$\blacksquare$

This proves the theorem. Since $C_t(F) \leq \lvert\mathrm{Im}(t)\rvert - 1$ for every positive projection $t$, minimizing over all such projections gives

$$
H^{*}(f) \leq C_{+}(f) \leq M_{+}(f) - 1.
$$

$\blacksquare$

## Consequences

1. The weighted-sum interpolation bound is never stronger than this sign-change bound, because a sequence with $M$ levels has at most $M-1$ sign changes.

2. For symmetric functions, taking $t(x)=\lvert x\rvert$ gives the exact sign-change count from [012_symmetric_sign_changes.md](012_symmetric_sign_changes.md).

3. The universal binary-weight projection gives

$$
H^{*}(f) \leq 2^n - 1
$$

for every Boolean function, but the sign-change count along that projection may be much smaller than $2^n - 1$.
