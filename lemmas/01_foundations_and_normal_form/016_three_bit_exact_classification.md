# Exact Three-Bit Classification

## Statement

For every Boolean function

$$
f : \{0,1\}^3 \to \{0,1\},
$$

we have

$$
H^{*}(f) = \deg_{\pm}(f).
$$

In particular, every three-bit Boolean function satisfies

$$
H^{*}(f) \leq 3.
$$

## Proof

The lower bound is already known:

$$
\deg_{\pm}(f) \leq H^{*}(f)
$$

by Lemma 6 of [../lemmas.md](../../lemmas.md). It remains to match this lower bound by upper bounds for threshold degree $0,1,2,3$.

### Lemma 1. Three-bit cubic thresholds use at most three heads

Let $f : \{0,1\}^3 \to \{0,1\}$. Suppose there is a multilinear polynomial $P$ of degree at most $3$ such that

$$
f(x)=1
\qquad \Longleftrightarrow \qquad
P(x)>0
$$

for every $x\in\{0,1\}^3$. Then

$$
H^{*}(f) \leq 3.
$$

**Proof.** Work in the multilinear polynomial basis

$$
1,\quad x_1,\quad x_2,\quad x_3,\quad x_1x_2,\quad x_1x_3,\quad x_2x_3,\quad x_1x_2x_3.
$$

Define three positive affine denominators

$$
\begin{aligned}
B_1(x) &:= 1+x_1+x_2+x_3, \\
B_2(x) &:= 1+x_1+2x_2+4x_3, \\
B_3(x) &:= 1+2x_1+3x_2+5x_3.
\end{aligned}
$$

The following coefficient table records products of two denominators with affine monomials, reduced using $x_i^2=x_i$ on the Boolean cube:

| Product | $1$ | $x_1$ | $x_2$ | $x_3$ | $x_1x_2$ | $x_1x_3$ | $x_2x_3$ | $x_1x_2x_3$ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| $B_2B_3$ | $1$ | $5$ | $11$ | $29$ | $7$ | $13$ | $22$ | $0$ |
| $x_1B_2B_3$ | $0$ | $6$ | $0$ | $0$ | $18$ | $42$ | $0$ | $22$ |
| $x_2B_2B_3$ | $0$ | $0$ | $12$ | $0$ | $12$ | $0$ | $51$ | $13$ |
| $x_3B_2B_3$ | $0$ | $0$ | $0$ | $30$ | $0$ | $18$ | $33$ | $7$ |
| $B_1B_3$ | $1$ | $5$ | $7$ | $11$ | $5$ | $7$ | $8$ | $0$ |
| $x_1B_1B_3$ | $0$ | $6$ | $0$ | $0$ | $12$ | $18$ | $0$ | $8$ |
| $x_2B_1B_3$ | $0$ | $0$ | $8$ | $0$ | $10$ | $0$ | $19$ | $7$ |
| $B_1B_2$ | $1$ | $3$ | $5$ | $9$ | $3$ | $5$ | $6$ | $0$ |

The determinant of this $8 \times 8$ table is

$$
-5723136,
$$

so these eight products form a basis for all multilinear polynomials on $\{0,1\}^3$.

Therefore, for every degree-at-most-$3$ polynomial $P$, there are affine functions $A_1,A_2,A_3$ with

$$
P(x)
=
A_1(x)B_2(x)B_3(x)
+A_2(x)B_1(x)B_3(x)
+A_3(x)B_1(x)B_2(x)
$$

on the Boolean cube. Since $B_1(x),B_2(x),B_3(x)>0$, the rational score

$$
S(x)
:=
\frac{A_1(x)}{B_1(x)}
+
\frac{A_2(x)}{B_2(x)}
+
\frac{A_3(x)}{B_3(x)}
$$

has the same sign as $P(x)$, because

$$
S(x)
=
\frac{P(x)}{B_1(x)B_2(x)B_3(x)}.
$$

Each summand $A_i(x)/B_i(x)$ is a one-head atom by Lemma 1 of [015_three_bit_quadratic_upper_bound.md](015_three_bit_quadratic_upper_bound.md). Hence thresholding the sum of three atoms computes $f$, so

$$
H^{*}(f) \leq 3.
$$

$\blacksquare$

### Lemma 2. Every three-bit function has threshold degree at most three

Every real-valued function on $\{0,1\}^3$ has a unique multilinear interpolation polynomial of degree at most $3$. In particular, for a Boolean function $f$, interpolate the values

$$
Q_f(x)
=
\begin{cases}
+1 & \text{if } f(x)=1, \\
-1 & \text{if } f(x)=0.
\end{cases}
$$

Then $Q_f$ sign-represents $f$, so

$$
\deg_{\pm}(f) \leq 3.
$$

### Lemma 3. The exact three-bit classification

Let

$$
d := \deg_{\pm}(f).
$$

By Lemma 2, $d\in\{0,1,2,3\}$.

1. If $d=0$, then $f$ is constant. By Lemma 11,

   $$
   H^{*}(f) = 0 = d.
   $$

2. If $d=1$, then $f$ is a nonconstant linear threshold function. By Lemma 11,

   $$
   H^{*}(f) = 1 = d.
   $$

3. If $d=2$, the threshold-degree lower bound gives $H^{*}(f) \geq 2$, while Lemma 15 gives $H^{*}(f) \leq 2$. Hence

   $$
   H^{*}(f) = 2 = d.
   $$

4. If $d=3$, the threshold-degree lower bound gives $H^{*}(f) \geq 3$, while Lemma 1 gives $H^{*}(f) \leq 3$. Hence

   $$
   H^{*}(f) = 3 = d.
   $$

Thus, for every $f : \{0,1\}^3 \to \{0,1\}$,

$$
H^{*}(f) = \deg_{\pm}(f).
$$

$\blacksquare$

## Consequence

The first dimensions now have exact characterizations:

- $n=1$: constants have $H^{*}=0$, nonconstant functions have $H^{*}=1$.
- $n=2$: the existing Lean development classifies all functions.
- $n=3$: the theorem above gives $H^{*}(f) = \deg_{\pm}(f)$ for every Boolean function.

The next genuine classification boundary is therefore $n=4$.
