# Local Certificate-Expansion Upper Bound

## Statement

Let $(P,N)$ be a partial assignment, where $P,N\subseteq\lbrace1,\ldots,n\rbrace$ are disjoint. Its cylinder is

$$
[P,N]
:=
\lbrace x\in\lbrace0,1\rbrace^n : x_i=1 \text{ for } i\in P,\ x_j=0 \text{ for } j\in N\rbrace.
$$

A family $\mathcal{C}_1$ of such partial assignments is a $1$-certificate cover for $f$ if

$$
f^{-1}(1)
\subseteq
\bigcup_{(P,N)\in\mathcal{C}_1}[P,N]
\subseteq
f^{-1}(1).
$$

If $\mathcal{C}_1$ is a $1$-certificate cover, then

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
\sum_{(P,N)\in\mathcal{C}_1}
\min\lbrace2^{\lvert P\rvert},2^{\lvert N\rvert}\rbrace.
$$

The dual statement holds for a $0$-certificate cover $\mathcal{C}_0$:

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
\sum_{(P,N)\in\mathcal{C}_0}
\min\lbrace2^{\lvert P\rvert},2^{\lvert N\rvert}\rbrace.
$$

> **Interpretation.** A one-sided certificate cover is cheap when each certificate fixes few bits of at least one sign. The cheaper sign may be chosen separately for each certificate.

## Proof

We first note a small extension of the polynomial-threshold sparsity construction. A signed positive monomial

$$
a\prod_{i\in S}x_i
$$

can be approximated uniformly by one head by [041_ptf_sparsity_upper_bound.md](041_ptf_sparsity_upper_bound.md). By global bit-flip invariance from [028_restrictions_and_sign_rank.md](028_restrictions_and_sign_rank.md), the same is true for a signed negative monomial

$$
a\prod_{i\in S}(1-x_i).
$$

Let $\mathcal{C}_1$ be a $1$-certificate cover. For a partial assignment $(P,N)$, define its indicator term

$$
T_{P,N}(x)
:=
\left(\prod_{i\in P}x_i\right)
\left(\prod_{j\in N}(1-x_j)\right).
$$

Since $\mathcal{C}_1$ covers exactly the true set, the polynomial

$$
Q(x)
:=
\sum_{(P,N)\in\mathcal{C}_1}T_{P,N}(x)-\frac{1}{2}
$$

strictly sign-represents $f$. Indeed, if $f(x)=0$, then no certificate cylinder contains $x$, so $Q(x)=-1/2$. If $f(x)=1$, then at least one certificate cylinder contains $x$, so $Q(x)\geq1/2$.

For each certificate term, choose the cheaper of two expansions. Expanding the negative literals gives

$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{P,N}(x)
&=
\left(\prod_{i\in P}x_i\right)
\left(\prod_{j\in N}(1-x_j)\right) \\
&=
\sum_{U\subseteq N}
(-1)^{\lvert U\rvert}
\prod_{i\in P\cup U}x_i.
\end{aligned}
$$

This costs $2^{\lvert N\rvert}$ positive monomials. Expanding the positive literals instead gives

$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{P,N}(x)
&=
\left(\prod_{i\in P}x_i\right)
\left(\prod_{j\in N}(1-x_j)\right) \\
&=
\sum_{U\subseteq P}
(-1)^{\lvert U\rvert}
\prod_{j\in N\cup U}(1-x_j).
\end{aligned}
$$

This costs $2^{\lvert P\rvert}$ negative monomials.

Choosing the cheaper expansion for each $(P,N)$, the polynomial $Q$ becomes a sum of at most

$$
M
:=
\sum_{(P,N)\in\mathcal{C}_1}
\min\lbrace2^{\lvert P\rvert},2^{\lvert N\rvert}\rbrace
$$

pure positive or pure negative monomials, plus a constant. If $M=0$, then $f$ is constant $0$ and the bound is trivial. Otherwise, approximate each nonconstant pure monomial term by one head with uniform error less than $1/(4M)$. The total approximation error is then less than $1/4$ on the cube.

Since $Q(x)\leq -1/2$ on false inputs and $Q(x)\geq1/2$ on true inputs, the approximating head score has the same sign as $Q$ everywhere. Therefore

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
\sum_{(P,N)\in\mathcal{C}_1}
\min\lbrace2^{\lvert P\rvert},2^{\lvert N\rvert}\rbrace.
$$

If $\mathcal{C}_0$ is a $0$-certificate cover for $f$, then it is a $1$-certificate cover for $1-f$. Applying the first part to $1-f$ and using complement invariance from [028_restrictions_and_sign_rank.md](028_restrictions_and_sign_rank.md) proves the $0$-certificate bound. $\blacksquare$

## Consequence

The mixed-literal DNF/CNF literal-expansion theorem [042_dnf_cnf_literal_expansion_upper_bound.md](042_dnf_cnf_literal_expansion_upper_bound.md) is strengthened to the local bound

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
\sum_a\min\lbrace2^{\lvert P_a\rvert},2^{\lvert N_a\rvert}\rbrace.
$$

The decision-tree leaf-profile theorem [043_decision_tree_upper_bound.md](043_decision_tree_upper_bound.md) is strengthened similarly. If a decision tree has depth at most $d$, then every leaf satisfies

$$
\min\lbrace\lvert P_\ell\rvert,\lvert N_\ell\rvert\rbrace
\leq
\left\lfloor\frac{d}{2}\right\rfloor.
$$

Thus every nonconstant $f$ satisfies

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
2^{D(f)+\lfloor D(f)/2\rfloor-1}.
$$

This bound complements the volume certificate theorem [040_certificate_cover_upper_bound.md](040_certificate_cover_upper_bound.md). Volume certificates are strongest for high-codimension cylinders in a large ambient cube, while local expansion certificates are strongest when each cylinder fixes few bits of at least one sign.
