# Positive-Order One-Bit Gate Sandwich

## Statement

Let $f:\{0,1\}^{m}\to\{0,1\}$, and let $C_{+}(f)$ be the optimized positive-projection sign-change count from [07_positive_projection_sign_changes.md](07_positive_projection_sign_changes.md). For a two-input gate $G$, define

$$
H_G(z,y):=G(z,f(y)).
$$

Then:

1. if $G$ is constant, then $H^{*}(H_G)=0$;
2. if $G$ is a raw-bit literal, then $H^{*}(H_G)=1$;
3. if $f$ is nonconstant and $G$ is XOR or XNOR, then

$$
\deg_{\pm}(f)+1
\leq
H^{*}(H_G)
\leq
C_{+}(f)+1;
$$

4. if $f$ is nonconstant and $G$ is any other feature-dependent gate, then

$$
\deg_{\pm}(f)
\leq
H^{*}(H_G)
\leq
C_{+}(f).
$$

For constant $f$, the same table reduces to the exact constant or raw-bit literal cases.

> **Interpretation.** The positive-order sign-change invariant is stable under one-bit gates, with exactly one extra unit for XOR and XNOR.

## Proof

The constant and raw-bit literal cases are immediate. If $f$ is constant, then every $G(z,f(y))$ is constant or a raw-bit literal, so the final sentence follows.

Assume now that $f$ is nonconstant. By the definition of $C_{+}(f)$, choose a positive weighted sum

$$
t(y)=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\lambda_i y_i,
\qquad
\lambda_i>0,
$$

and a function $F$ on the image of $t$ such that

$$
f(y)=F(t(y))
$$

and the ordered label sequence of $F$ has exactly $C_{+}(f)$ sign changes.

Apply the positive-statistic one-bit gate sandwich [143_positive_statistic_one_bit_gate_sandwich.md](143_positive_statistic_one_bit_gate_sandwich.md) to $T=f$ and $C=C_{+}(f)$. The lower bounds are the one-bit gate threshold-degree trichotomy and the general inequality $\deg_{\pm}\leq H^{*}$; the upper bounds are Lemmas 139 and 140 optimized over the positive projection. $\blacksquare$

## Consequence

The desired recursion

$$
H^{*}(z\oplus f)\leq H^{*}(f)+1
$$

holds for every function with $H^{*}(f)=C_{+}(f)$. More generally, this lemma gives the proved fallback

$$
H^{*}(z\oplus f)\leq C_{+}(f)+1
$$

for every Boolean function $f$.
