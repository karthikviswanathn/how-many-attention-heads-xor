# Singleton Parity Multigrid Separation

## Statement

Let

$$
\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{sing}}=\lbrace\lbrace1\rbrace,\ldots,\lbrace n\rbrace\rbrace
$$

be the singleton partition, and let $f=\mathrm{XOR}_n$. Define

$$
L_n
:=
\sum_{\substack{1\leq \ell\leq n\\ n-\ell\ \mathrm{even}}}2^{\ell-1}.
$$

Equivalently,

$$
L_n=
\begin{cases}
\dfrac{2^{n+1}-1}{3} & \text{if } n \text{ is odd},\\[6pt]
\dfrac{2^{n+1}-2}{3} & \text{if } n \text{ is even}.
\end{cases}
$$

Then, with $\mathrm{mhc}$ computed for the singleton Hamming profile of parity,

$$
\mathrm{mgc}_{+}^{\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{sing}}}(\mathrm{XOR}_n)
=
\mathrm{mhc}(\mathrm{XOR}_n)
=
L_n,
$$

while

$$
H^{*}(\mathrm{XOR}_n)=n.
$$

Thus the singleton-block multigrid cost can be larger than the true head complexity by a factor

$$
\frac{L_n}{n}.
$$

> **Interpretation.** Multigrid cost is a certificate cost, not an exact invariant of $H^{*}$. For parity, the singleton partition forces a long binary odometer traversal, while the total Hamming-weight collapse gives the exact $n$-head value.

## Proof

For the singleton partition, every positive block statistic has the form

$$
t_i(x_i)=\lambda_i x_i,
\qquad
\lambda_i>0.
$$

Its image is $\lbrace0,\lambda_i\rbrace$. Therefore every lexicographic product-grid traversal is just the usual binary odometer traversal for some coordinate order. The labels for $\mathrm{XOR}_n$ are the parity of the number of coordinates at their nonzero level. The positive weights $\lambda_i$ do not affect these labels.

Fix any coordinate order and number its coordinates $1,\ldots,n$ from slowest to fastest. A transition of type $\ell$ is a transition where coordinate $\ell$ changes from $0$ to $1$, all faster coordinates reset from $1$ to $0$, and the slower coordinates are unchanged.

There are exactly

$$
2^{\ell-1}
$$

transitions of type $\ell$, because the $\ell-1$ slower coordinates are arbitrary.

Across a type $\ell$ transition, the Hamming weight changes by

$$
1-(n-\ell).
$$

Parity flips exactly when this number is odd, equivalently when $n-\ell$ is even. Hence every coordinate order has exactly

$$
\sum_{\substack{1\leq \ell\leq n\\ n-\ell\ \mathrm{even}}}2^{\ell-1}
=
L_n
$$

lexicographic sign changes. This proves both the $\mathrm{mgc}_{+}^{\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{sing}}}$ value and the singleton Hamming-profile value $\mathrm{mhc}$.

The closed form follows by summing the corresponding geometric progression:

$$
L_n=
\begin{cases}
1+4+\cdots+2^{n-1}=\dfrac{2^{n+1}-1}{3} & \text{if } n \text{ is odd},\\[6pt]
2+8+\cdots+2^{n-1}=\dfrac{2^{n+1}-2}{3} & \text{if } n \text{ is even}.
\end{cases}
$$

Finally, $\mathrm{XOR}_n$ is symmetric and its Hamming-weight truth table changes at every adjacent pair of weights. The exact symmetric sign-change theorem [012_symmetric_sign_changes.md](../01_foundations_and_normal_form/012_symmetric_sign_changes.md) gives

$$
H^{*}(\mathrm{XOR}_n)=n.
$$

This proves the separation. $\blacksquare$

## Consequence

For parity, Theorem 175 with the total Hamming-weight projection gives the exact value $n$, while the singleton multigrid certificate costs $L_n$. Coarser positive projections can therefore be essential.
