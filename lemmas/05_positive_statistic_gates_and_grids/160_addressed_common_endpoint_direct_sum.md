# Addressed Common-Endpoint Direct Sum

## Statement

Let $A\subseteq\lbrace0,1\rbrace^{k}$ be a set of raw addresses. Let

$$
t(y)=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\lambda_i y_i,
\qquad
\lambda_i>0,
$$

with ordered image

$$
\tau_0<\tau_1<\cdots<\tau_{M-1}.
$$

For each $a\in A$, let

$$
T_a(y)=F_a(t(y))
$$

be a positive-statistic feature with sign-change count $C_a$. Suppose there is a common background label $b\in\lbrace0,1\rbrace$ such that

$$
F_a(\tau_0)=F_a(\tau_{M-1})=b
\qquad
\text{for every }a\in A.
$$

Define a function $f_A(z,y)$ by

$$
f_A(a,y)=T_a(y)
\quad\text{for }a\in A,
\qquad
f_A(a,y)=b
\quad\text{for }a\notin A.
$$

Then

$$
\max_{a\in A}H^{*}(T_a)
\leq
H^{*}(f_A)
\leq
\sum_{a\in A}C_a.
$$

Consequently, if $A=\lbrace a_0\rbrace$ and $H^{*}(T_{a_0})=C_{a_0}$, then

$$
H^{*}(f_A)=C_{a_0}.
$$

More generally, if each $T_a$ has a univariate sign polynomial in $t$ of degree at most $d_a$, then

$$
\max_{a\in A}\deg_{\pm}(T_a)
\leq
H^{*}(f_A)
\leq
\sum_{a\in A}d_a.
$$

> **Interpretation.** Several features with the same endpoint background can be placed at disjoint raw addresses with additive head cost and no boundary penalty. A single addressed exact feature stays exact.

## Proof

Extend the slice family to every raw assignment by setting

$$
F_a(u):=b
\qquad
\text{for }a\notin A.
$$

Every slice now factors through the same positive statistic $t$. The endpoint labels of every slice are $b$, and the constant background slices have sign-change count $0$.

The shared-statistic slice sandwich [158_shared_statistic_slice_sandwich.md](158_shared_statistic_slice_sandwich.md) gives

$$
\max_a H^{*}\bigl(F_a(t(y))\bigr)
\leq
H^{*}(f_A)
\leq
\sum_a C_a.
$$

The maximum and sum ignore the constant background slices, so this is exactly

$$
\max_{a\in A}H^{*}(T_a)
\leq
H^{*}(f_A)
\leq
\sum_{a\in A}C_a.
$$

If $A=\lbrace a_0\rbrace$ and $H^{*}(T_{a_0})=C_{a_0}$, the two sides match.

For the degree version, apply the shared-statistic degree sandwich [159_shared_statistic_degree_sandwich.md](159_shared_statistic_degree_sandwich.md). The constant background slices have degree $0$, so only the addresses in $A$ contribute to the upper bound, and the lower bound is the maximum threshold degree among the addressed slices. $\blacksquare$

## Consequence

Theorem 156 is the single-address case with one feature. The present theorem allows many addressed features, provided they share the same positive statistic and the same endpoint background.
