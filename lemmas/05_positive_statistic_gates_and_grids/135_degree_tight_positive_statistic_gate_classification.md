# Degree-Tight Positive-Statistic Gate Classification

## Statement

Let

$$
t(y)=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\lambda_i y_i,
\qquad
\lambda_i>0,
$$

and let $T(y)=F(t(y))$ be nonconstant. Let $C$ be the sign-change count of $F$ along the ordered image of $t$. Assume

$$
\deg_{\pm}(T)=C.
$$

For any two-input Boolean gate $G$, define

$$
H_G(z,y):=G(z,T(y)).
$$

Then

$$
H^{*}(H_G)=
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if }G\text{ is constant},\\
1 & \text{if }G\text{ is a raw-bit literal},\\
C+1 & \text{if }G\text{ is XOR or XNOR},\\
C & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$

> **Interpretation.** Whenever the positive-statistic sign-change upper bound is threshold-degree tight for the feature, the complete one-bit gate table is exact.

## Proof

Constants and raw-bit literals have exact values $0$ and $1$ by the zero-head and one-head classification.

For XOR and XNOR, the positive-statistic fresh-XOR sign-change bound [133_positive_statistic_fresh_xor_sign_change_bound.md](133_positive_statistic_fresh_xor_sign_change_bound.md) gives

$$
H^{*}(H_G)\leq C+1.
$$

The one-bit gate threshold-degree trichotomy [76_one_bit_gate_threshold_degree_trichotomy.md](../04_recursions_and_cost_invariants/76_one_bit_gate_threshold_degree_trichotomy.md) gives

$$
\deg_{\pm}(H_G)=\deg_{\pm}(T)+1=C+1.
$$

Thus XOR and XNOR have exact value $C+1$.

For every remaining nonconstant gate, the positive-statistic non-XOR gate bound [134_positive_statistic_non_xor_gate_sign_change_bound.md](134_positive_statistic_non_xor_gate_sign_change_bound.md) gives

$$
H^{*}(H_G)\leq C.
$$

The one-bit gate threshold-degree trichotomy gives

$$
\deg_{\pm}(H_G)=\deg_{\pm}(T)=C.
$$

Thus these gates have exact value $C$. $\blacksquare$

## Consequence

Internal positive slabs are the case $C=2$. LTF features are the case $C=1$. The same table now applies to every positive-statistic feature whose sign-change count equals its threshold degree.
