# Positive Grid Degree And Exactness

## Statement

Use the setup of Theorem 165. Suppose that for each raw level $\nu_r$ there is a univariate polynomial $P_r(v)$ of degree at most $d_r$ such that

$$
\mathrm{sgn}(P_r(t(y)))=
\begin{cases}
+1 & \text{if } F(\nu_r,t(y))=1,\\
-1 & \text{if } F(\nu_r,t(y))=0
\end{cases}
$$

for every $y\in\lbrace0,1\rbrace^{m}$. Let

$$
\delta_r:=\deg_{\pm}\bigl(F(\nu_r,t(y))\bigr).
$$

Then

$$
\max_r\delta_r
\leq
H^{*}(f)
\leq
\sum_{r=0}^{R-1}d_r+J_{\mathrm{grid}}.
$$

If $d_r\leq d$ for every $r$, then

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq Rd+J_{\mathrm{grid}}.
$$

Moreover, if

$$ \deg_{\pm}(f) = \sum_{r=0}^{R-1}C_r+J_{\mathrm{grid}}, $$

then

$$
H^{*}(f)=\deg_{\pm}(f).
$$

> **Interpretation.** On a positive grid, the upper bound scales with the number of raw statistic levels. It becomes exact whenever threshold degree reaches the grid concatenation cost.

## Proof

The lower bound follows by restricting to a raw assignment at each raw level and using the threshold-degree lower bound:

$$
\delta_r
\leq
H^{*}\bigl(F(\nu_r,t(y))\bigr)
\leq
H^{*}(f).
$$

For the upper bound, let $C_r$ be the sign-change count of slice $r$. Since $P_r$ strictly sign-represents that slice, every adjacent sign change along the ordered image of $t$ gives a distinct real root of $P_r$. Hence

$$
C_r\leq d_r.
$$

The positive grid slice sandwich [165_positive_grid_slice_sandwich.md](165_positive_grid_slice_sandwich.md) gives

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
\sum_r C_r+J_{\mathrm{grid}}
\leq
\sum_r d_r+J_{\mathrm{grid}}.
$$

If $d_r\leq d$ for every $r$, then $\sum_r d_r\leq Rd$.

For exactness, combine the positive grid upper bound

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq\sum_r C_r+J_{\mathrm{grid}}
$$

with the threshold-degree lower bound

$$
\deg_{\pm}(f)\leq H^{*}(f).
$$

If the two endpoint quantities are equal, then all inequalities are equalities. $\blacksquare$

## Consequence

Theorem 162 applies directly to positive grids after the raw assignments are compressed into raw statistic levels.
