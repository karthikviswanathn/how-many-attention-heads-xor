# Endpoint Variation Shared-Statistic Bound

## Statement

Use the setup of Theorem 158. Thus every raw slice factors through one positive statistic:

$$
f(a,y)=F_a(t(y)),
\qquad
t(y)=\sum_i\lambda_i y_i,
\qquad
\lambda_i>0.
$$

Let $C_a$ be the sign-change count of $F_a$ along the ordered image of $t$, and define endpoint raw functions

$$
q(a):=F_a(\tau_0),
\qquad
p(a):=F_a(\tau_{M-1}).
$$

Then

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
\sum_a C_a+\min\{C_{+}(p),C_{+}(q)\}+D(p,q),
$$

where

$$
D(p,q):=\left\lvert\{a:p(a)\neq q(a)\}\right\rvert.
$$

Moreover, suppose $p$ has a positive raw order in which its true set has $q_p$ intervals and endpoint labels $\epsilon^p_0,\epsilon^p_1$. Define

$$
K_p:=
\begin{cases}
0, & q_p=0,\\
2q_p-\epsilon^p_0-\epsilon^p_1, & q_p\geq1.
\end{cases}
$$

Define $K_q$ analogously if $q$ has such a run certificate. If both certificates are available, then

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
\sum_a C_a+\min\{K_p,K_q\}+D(p,q).
$$

> **Interpretation.** The endpoint coupling can be bounded by ordinary raw endpoint variation plus the number of slices whose two endpoints disagree. Few-run endpoint functions give a concrete version of the bound.

## Proof

The shared-statistic slice sandwich [152_shared_statistic_slice_sandwich.md](152_shared_statistic_slice_sandwich.md) gives

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
\sum_a C_a+B_{+}(p,q).
$$

The mixed boundary inequality [147_mixed_boundary_inequality.md](147_mixed_boundary_inequality.md) gives

$$
B_{+}(p,q)
\leq
\min\{C_{+}(p),C_{+}(q)\}+D(p,q).
$$

Substituting proves the first bound.

For the few-run version, Theorem 157 applied to the raw endpoint functions gives

$$
C_{+}(p)\leq K_p,
\qquad
C_{+}(q)\leq K_q.
$$

Thus

$$
\min\{C_{+}(p),C_{+}(q)\}\leq\min\{K_p,K_q\}.
$$

Substitute this into the first bound. $\blacksquare$

## Consequence

Theorem 158 is strongest when $B_{+}(p,q)$ is computed exactly. This theorem gives a practical fallback using only endpoint run counts and endpoint disagreement.
