# Positive-Statistic Fresh-XOR Sign-Change Bound

## Statement

Let

$$
t(y)=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\lambda_i y_i,
\qquad
\lambda_i>0,
$$

and let $T(y)=F(t(y))$ be nonconstant. Write the ordered image of $t$ as

$$
\tau_0<\tau_1<\cdots<\tau_{M-1},
$$

and let $C$ be the number of sign changes in the label sequence

$$
F(\tau_0),F(\tau_1),\ldots,F(\tau_{M-1}).
$$

Then

$$
\deg_{\pm}(T)+1
\leq
H^{*}(z\oplus T(y))
\leq
C+1,
$$

and the same bounds hold for XNOR. In particular, if $\deg_{\pm}(T)=C$, then

$$
H^{*}(z\oplus T(y))
=
H^{*}(1-(z\oplus T(y)))
=
C+1.
$$

> **Interpretation.** For positive-statistic features, fresh XOR costs at most one more than the original one-dimensional sign-change count, not the separated two-slice sign-change count.

## Proof

Because $T$ is nonconstant, $C\geq1$. For every index $j$ with

$$
F(\tau_j)\neq F(\tau_{j+1}),
$$

choose a point

$$
\gamma_j\in(\tau_j,\tau_{j+1}).
$$

Define

$$
Q(u):=\sigma\prod_j(u-\gamma_j),
$$

where the product ranges over the sign-change indices and the sign $\sigma\in\{1,-1\}$ is chosen so that $Q(\tau_0)>0$ exactly when $F(\tau_0)=1$. As $u$ moves through the ordered image of $t$, the sign of $Q$ flips exactly at the chosen sign-change gaps and nowhere else. Thus

$$
T(y)=1
\qquad\Longleftrightarrow\qquad
Q(t(y))>0,
$$

and $\deg Q=C$.

The polynomial

$$
P(z,y):=(1-2z)Q(t(y))
$$

strictly sign-represents $z\oplus T(y)$. It has degree at most $C+1$ in the two quantities $t(y)$ and $z$, reduced using $z^2=z$. The positive-statistic raw-bit degree span [138_positive_statistic_raw_bit_degree_span.md](138_positive_statistic_raw_bit_degree_span.md) gives

$$
H^{*}(z\oplus T(y))\leq C+1.
$$

The lower bound is the fresh-bit XOR threshold-degree theorem [75_fresh_bit_xor_threshold_degree.md](75_fresh_bit_xor_threshold_degree.md):

$$
H^{*}(z\oplus T(y))
\geq
\deg_{\pm}(z\oplus T(y))
=
\deg_{\pm}(T)+1.
$$

XNOR is the output complement of XOR, so complement invariance gives the same bounds and exactness statement. $\blacksquare$

## Consequence

For internal positive slabs, $C=2$ and $\deg_{\pm}(T)=2$, so fresh XOR and XNOR have exact value $3$. More generally, every threshold-degree-tight positive-statistic sequence remains exact after XOR with one fresh raw bit.
