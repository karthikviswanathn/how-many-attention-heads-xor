# Multi-Raw Positive-Statistic Degree Bound

## Statement

Let $k\geq0$, let $z\in\{0,1\}^{k}$ be raw bits, and let

$$
t(y)=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\lambda_i y_i,
\qquad
\lambda_i>0.
$$

Suppose $P(z,y)$ is a strict sign polynomial for a Boolean function $f(z,y)$, and suppose that for each raw assignment $a\in\{0,1\}^{k}$, the slice

$$
P_a(u):=P(a,y)\quad\text{with }u=t(y)
$$

is a univariate polynomial in $u$ of degree at most $d_a$. Then

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
\sum_{a\in\{0,1\}^{k}} d_a
+
2^{k}-1.
$$

In particular, if $P$ has degree at most $d$ in the quantities $t(y),z_1,\ldots,z_k$, reduced multilinearly in the raw bits, then

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq 2^{k}(d+1)-1.
$$

> **Interpretation.** A bounded-degree threshold in one positive statistic and $k$ raw bits has a head bound exponential only in the number of raw bits, and independent of the number of feature variables.

## Proof

Fix a raw assignment $a$. Since $P$ strictly sign-represents $f$, the slice polynomial $P_a$ is nonzero on every point of the ordered image of $t$. If the sign of $P_a$ changes between two consecutive image points, the intermediate value theorem gives a real root of $P_a$ between those two points. Distinct adjacent sign changes give distinct open intervals, hence distinct roots. Therefore the sign-change count $C_a$ of the slice $f(a,y)$ along $t$ satisfies

$$
C_a\leq d_a.
$$

The common positive-statistic multi-slice bound [145_common_positive_statistic_multi_slice_bound.md](145_common_positive_statistic_multi_slice_bound.md) gives

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
\sum_{a\in\{0,1\}^{k}}C_a
+
2^k-1
\leq
\sum_{a\in\{0,1\}^{k}}d_a
+
2^k-1.
$$

If $P$ has total degree at most $d$ in $t(y),z_1,\ldots,z_k$, then every raw slice has degree at most $d$, so

$$
\sum_{a\in\{0,1\}^{k}}d_a\leq2^k d.
$$

This gives

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq2^k d+2^k-1=2^k(d+1)-1.
$$

$\blacksquare$

## Consequence

For fixed raw-bit count $k$ and fixed degree $d$, this is a dimension-free head bound for all functions whose dependence on the remaining variables factors through one positive statistic. It is weaker than Lemma 138 when $k=1$, but it applies to arbitrary many unrelated raw slices.
