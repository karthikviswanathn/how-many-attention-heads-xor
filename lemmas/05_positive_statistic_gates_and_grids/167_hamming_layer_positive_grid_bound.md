# Hamming-Layer Positive Grid Bound

## Statement

Let $z\in\lbrace0,1\rbrace^{k}$ and $y\in\lbrace0,1\rbrace^{m}$. Suppose

$$ f(z,y)=F(\lvert z\rvert,t(y)), \qquad t(y)=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\lambda_i y_i, \qquad \lambda_i>0. $$

For each Hamming layer $r\in\lbrace0,\ldots,k\rbrace$, let $C_r$ be the sign-change count of

$$ \tau\mapsto F(r,\tau) $$

along the ordered image of $t$. Let

$$ J_{\mathrm{Ham}} := \left\lvert \left\lbrace r\in\lbrace0,\ldots,k-1\rbrace: F(r,\tau_{M-1})\neq F(r+1,\tau_0) \right\rbrace \right\rvert. $$

Then

$$ \max_{0\leq r\leq k}H^{*}\bigl(F(r,t(y))\bigr) \leq H^{*}(f) \leq \sum_{r=0}^{k}C_r+J_{\mathrm{Ham}}. $$

If each Hamming-layer slice has a univariate sign polynomial in $t$ of degree at most $d_r$, then

$$ H^{*}(f)\leq\sum_{r=0}^{k}d_r+J_{\mathrm{Ham}}. $$

If $d_r\leq d$ for all $r$, then

$$ H^{*}(f)\leq(k+1)d+J_{\mathrm{Ham}}. $$

> **Interpretation.** A raw block that appears only through Hamming weight costs $k+1$ raw layers, not $2^k$ raw assignments.

## Proof

Apply the positive grid slice sandwich [165_positive_grid_slice_sandwich.md](165_positive_grid_slice_sandwich.md) with

$$ u(z)=\lvert z\rvert. $$

The image of $u$ is $0,1,\ldots,k$, so the grid boundary term is exactly $J_{\mathrm{Ham}}$. This gives the first bracket.

The degree bounds follow from [166_positive_grid_degree_exactness.md](166_positive_grid_degree_exactness.md), again with $u(z)=\lvert z\rvert$. $\blacksquare$

## Consequence

This theorem gives a dimension-free upper bound for functions depending on a raw block only through Hamming weight and on the remaining variables through one positive statistic.
