# Symmetric-Feature One-Bit Gate Exactness

## Statement

Let

$$
T:\lbrace0,1\rbrace^{m}\to\lbrace0,1\rbrace
$$

be a nonconstant symmetric Boolean function. Let $C$ be the number of sign changes in its Hamming-weight sequence

$$
T(0),T(1),\ldots,T(m).
$$

For any two-input Boolean gate $G$, define

$$
H_G(z,y):=G(z,T(y)).
$$

Then

$$
H^{*}(H_G)=
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if }G\text{ is constant},\\
1 & \text{if }G\text{ is a raw-bit literal},\\
C+1 & \text{if }G\text{ is XOR or XNOR},\\
C & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$

> **Interpretation.** The exact symmetric classification is stable under adjoining one raw bit and applying any two-input gate.

## Proof

Write

$$
t(y)=\sum_{i=1}^{m}y_i.
$$

Then $T(y)=F(t(y))$ for a positive statistic $t$, and $C$ is exactly the sign-change count of $F$ on the ordered image $\lbrace0,1,\ldots,m\rbrace$.

The symmetric exactness theorem [012_symmetric_sign_changes.md](../01_foundations_and_normal_form/012_symmetric_sign_changes.md) gives

$$
\deg_{\pm}(T)=H^{*}(T)=C.
$$

The degree-tight positive-statistic gate classification [141_degree_tight_positive_statistic_gate_classification.md](141_degree_tight_positive_statistic_gate_classification.md) now applies and gives the displayed table. $\blacksquare$

## Consequence

For parity on $m$ feature variables, $C=m$. Thus XOR with a fresh raw bit has exact value $m+1$, while every non-XOR feature-dependent one-bit gate over parity has exact value $m$.
