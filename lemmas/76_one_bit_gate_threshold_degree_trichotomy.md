# One-Bit Gate Threshold-Degree Trichotomy

## Statement

Let

$$
T:\{0,1\}^{m}\to\{0,1\}
$$

be nonconstant, and set

$$
d:=\deg_{\pm}(T).
$$

Let

$$
G:\{0,1\}^{2}\to\{0,1\}
$$

be any Boolean gate, and define

$$
F(z,y):=G(z,T(y)).
$$

For $b\in\{0,1\}$, write

$$
G_b(u):=G(b,u).
$$

Each slice $G_b$ is one of $0$, $1$, $u$, or $1-u$. Then:

1. If $G_0$ and $G_1$ are both constant, then

$$
\deg_{\pm}(F)
=
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } G_0=G_1,\\
1 & \text{if } G_0\neq G_1.
\end{cases}
$$

2. If at least one slice is nonconstant and the nonconstant slices, when there are two, are not opposite, then

$$
\deg_{\pm}(F)=d.
$$

3. If $\{G_0,G_1\}=\{u,1-u\}$, then

$$
\deg_{\pm}(F)=d+1.
$$

Consequently, fresh-bit AND, OR, implication, and their complements preserve threshold degree when the feature branch is nonconstant, while XOR and XNOR raise threshold degree by exactly one.

## Proof

Since $T$ is nonconstant, $d\geq1$.

### Constant slices

If $G_0$ and $G_1$ are the same constant, then $F$ is constant, so $\deg_{\pm}(F)=0$.

If $G_0$ and $G_1$ are different constants, then $F$ is either $z$ or $1-z$. Hence it is a nonconstant LTF and

$$
\deg_{\pm}(F)=1.
$$

### Same nonconstant slice

Suppose $G_0=G_1=u$ or $G_0=G_1=1-u$. Then $F$ is either $T$ or $1-T$, ignoring $z$. Negating a strict sign polynomial swaps a function with its complement, so complements have the same threshold degree. Therefore

$$
\deg_{\pm}(F)=d.
$$

### Exactly one nonconstant slice

Suppose first that $G_0$ is constant and $G_1$ is nonconstant. Let $U$ be the $z=1$ slice, so $U$ is either $T$ or $1-T$. Choose a strict sign polynomial $P(y)$ for $U$ with degree $d$:

$$
U(y)=1
\qquad\Longleftrightarrow\qquad
P(y)>0.
$$

Choose

$$
M>\max_{y\in\{0,1\}^{m}}\lvert P(y)\rvert.
$$

If $G_0$ is the constant $1$ function, define

$$
R(z,y):=P(y)+M(1-z).
$$

Then $R(1,y)=P(y)$ and $R(0,y)>0$ for every $y$.

If $G_0$ is the constant $0$ function, define

$$
R(z,y):=P(y)-M(1-z).
$$

Then $R(1,y)=P(y)$ and $R(0,y)<0$ for every $y$.

In either case, $R$ strictly sign-represents $F$ and has degree at most $d$, because $d\geq1$.

The lower bound

$$
\deg_{\pm}(F)\geq d
$$

follows by restricting to the slice $z=1$, where $F$ equals $U$. Thus $\deg_{\pm}(F)=d$.

The case where $G_0$ is nonconstant and $G_1$ is constant is the same, replacing $1-z$ by $z$.

### Opposite nonconstant slices

If $G_0=u$ and $G_1=1-u$, then

$$
F(z,y)=z\oplus T(y).
$$

By the fresh-bit XOR threshold-degree theorem [75_fresh_bit_xor_threshold_degree.md](75_fresh_bit_xor_threshold_degree.md),

$$
\deg_{\pm}(F)=d+1.
$$

If $G_0=1-u$ and $G_1=u$, then $F$ is the complement of $z\oplus T(y)$. Complementing preserves threshold degree, so again

$$
\deg_{\pm}(F)=d+1.
$$

These cases exhaust all possibilities for the pair of slices $G_0,G_1$. $\blacksquare$

## Consequences

For nonconstant $T$,

$$
\deg_{\pm}(z\wedge T(y))
=
\deg_{\pm}(z\vee T(y))
=
\deg_{\pm}(T),
$$

while

$$
\deg_{\pm}(z\oplus T(y))
=
\deg_{\pm}(T)+1.
$$

Thus the lower-bound behavior of one-bit branching depends on the gate, not just on the presence of a fresh raw bit.
