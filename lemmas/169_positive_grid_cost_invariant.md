# Positive Grid Cost Invariant

## Statement

For a fixed split $(z,y)$, define $\operatorname{pgc}_{+}^{z\mid y}(f)$ to be the minimum of

$$
\sum_{r=0}^{R-1}C_r+J_{\mathrm{grid}}
$$

over all positive-grid certificates

$$
u(z)=\sum_j\rho_jz_j,
\qquad
t(y)=\sum_i\lambda_i y_i,
\qquad
\rho_j,\lambda_i>0,
$$

and all functions $F$ such that

$$
f(z,y)=F(u(z),t(y)).
$$

Here $C_r$ and $J_{\mathrm{grid}}$ are the raw-level slice variation and endpoint-jump terms from Theorem 165. Then

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq\operatorname{pgc}_{+}^{z\mid y}(f).
$$

Moreover, if $C_{+}(f)$ denotes the optimized positive-projection sign-change count, then

$$
C_{+}(f)\leq\operatorname{pgc}_{+}^{z\mid y}(f).
$$

The cost $\operatorname{pgc}_{+}^{z\mid y}$ is invariant under output complement, raw-coordinate permutation, and feature-coordinate permutation.

Finally, if

$$
\deg_{\pm}(f)=\operatorname{pgc}_{+}^{z\mid y}(f),
$$

then

$$
H^{*}(f)=\deg_{\pm}(f)=\operatorname{pgc}_{+}^{z\mid y}(f).
$$

> **Interpretation.** Positive-grid cost is an optimized split invariant. It can be much smaller than raw-assignment slice cost when many raw assignments share one raw statistic level.

## Proof

For any fixed positive-grid certificate, Theorem 165 gives

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq\sum_r C_r+J_{\mathrm{grid}}.
$$

Minimizing over certificates proves

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq\operatorname{pgc}_{+}^{z\mid y}(f).
$$

The proof of Theorem 165 constructs a single positive statistic

$$
s(z,y)=Ku(z)+t(y)
$$

whose ordered label sequence has exactly

$$
\sum_r C_r+J_{\mathrm{grid}}
$$

sign changes. Therefore the optimized positive-projection sign-change count satisfies

$$
C_{+}(f)\leq\sum_r C_r+J_{\mathrm{grid}}
$$

for every grid certificate. Taking the minimum gives

$$
C_{+}(f)\leq\operatorname{pgc}_{+}^{z\mid y}(f).
$$

For output complement, the same grid certificates remain feasible, and replacing $F$ by $1-F$ preserves every within-level sign-change count and every endpoint-jump count. Hence the cost is unchanged.

Raw-coordinate and feature-coordinate permutations transport positive statistics by permuting their positive coefficients. The grid images, slice sign-change counts, and endpoint jumps are unchanged after relabeling. Thus the optimized cost is invariant under those permutations.

If $\deg_{\pm}(f)=\operatorname{pgc}_{+}^{z\mid y}(f)$, then the threshold-degree lower bound gives

$$
\operatorname{pgc}_{+}^{z\mid y}(f)
=
\deg_{\pm}(f)
\leq
H^{*}(f)
\leq
\operatorname{pgc}_{+}^{z\mid y}(f),
$$

so equality holds throughout. $\blacksquare$

## Consequence

Theorem 166 can be restated as a certificate-level exactness theorem for $\operatorname{pgc}_{+}^{z\mid y}$.
