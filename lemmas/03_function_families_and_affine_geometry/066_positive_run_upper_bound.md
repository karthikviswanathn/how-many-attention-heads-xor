# Positive Run-Count Upper Bound

## Statement

Let

$$
f:\lbrace0,1\rbrace^n\to\lbrace0,1\rbrace.
$$

Let

$$
t(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\lambda_i x_i,
\qquad
\lambda_i>0,
$$

be injective on the Boolean cube. List the cube points in increasing order of $t$:

$$
x^{(0)},x^{(1)},\ldots,x^{(2^n-1)}.
$$

For $b\in\lbrace0,1\rbrace$, let $R_t^b(f)$ be the number of maximal contiguous blocks of indices $j$ for which

$$
f(x^{(j)})=b.
$$

Then

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
2\min\lbrace R_t^0(f),R_t^1(f)\rbrace.
$$

Consequently, if

$$
R_{+}(f)
:=
\min_t\min\lbrace R_t^0(f),R_t^1(f)\rbrace,
$$

where the minimum ranges over injective positive weighted sums $t$, then

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq2R_{+}(f).
$$

> **Interpretation.** Sparse support is only the coarsest version of the positive-projection argument. What really matters is how many runs the cheaper label class forms in some positive ordering of the cube.

## Proof

Fix an injective positive weighted sum $t$. Since $t$ is injective, $f$ factors through $t$.

Let

$$
a_j:=f(x^{(j)})
$$

be the ordered label sequence. The number of sign changes in this sequence is at most twice the number of $1$-runs:

$$
C_t(f)\leq2R_t^1(f).
$$

Indeed, each $1$-run contributes at most one sign change when entering the run and at most one sign change when leaving it. The same argument gives

$$
C_t(f)\leq2R_t^0(f).
$$

Therefore

$$
C_t(f)\leq2\min\lbrace R_t^0(f),R_t^1(f)\rbrace.
$$

The positive-projection sign-change theorem [013_positive_projection_sign_changes.md](../01_foundations_and_normal_form/013_positive_projection_sign_changes.md) gives

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq C_t(f),
$$

and hence

$$
H^{*}(f)
\leq
2\min\lbrace R_t^0(f),R_t^1(f)\rbrace.
$$

Optimizing over injective positive weighted sums $t$ proves the $R_{+}(f)$ bound. $\blacksquare$

## Consequence

The sparse-support upper bound [037_sparse_support_upper_bound.md](../02_complexity_measure_upper_bounds/037_sparse_support_upper_bound.md) follows immediately. If $s(f)$ is the size of the smaller label class, then every run of that label contains at least one point, so

$$
R_{+}(f)\leq s(f),
$$

and therefore

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq2s(f).
$$

The run-count invariant can be strictly smaller than support size. If the smaller label class is contiguous in some positive ordering, then

$$
R_{+}(f)=1
$$

and the theorem gives a two-head upper bound.
