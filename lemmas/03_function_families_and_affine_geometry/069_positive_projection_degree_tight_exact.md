# Positive-Projection Degree-Tight Exactness

## Statement

Let

$$
f:\lbrace0,1\rbrace^n\to\lbrace0,1\rbrace.
$$

Let $C_{+}(f)$ be the minimum positive-projection sign-change count from [013_positive_projection_sign_changes.md](../01_foundations_and_normal_form/013_positive_projection_sign_changes.md). Then

$$
\deg_{\pm}(f)
\leq
H^{*}(f)
\leq
C_{+}(f).
$$

Consequently, if

$$
\deg_{\pm}(f)=C_{+}(f),
$$

then

$$
H^{*}(f)=\deg_{\pm}(f)=C_{+}(f).
$$

More generally, suppose $f$ factors through a positive weighted sum $t$ with sign-change count $C_t(f)$. If

$$
\deg_{\pm}(f)=C_t(f),
$$

then

$$
H^{*}(f)=C_t(f).
$$

Finally, the low-alternation regime is exact. If

$$
C_{+}(f)\leq2,
$$

then

$$ H^{*}(f) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } f \text{ is constant},\\ 1 & \text{if } f \text{ is a nonconstant linear threshold function},\\ 2 & \text{otherwise}. \end{cases} $$

> **Interpretation.** The positive-projection sign-change count is an exact invariant whenever it meets threshold degree. This turns any matching pair of certificates into an exact value of $H^{*}$.

## Proof

The lower bound

$$
\deg_{\pm}(f)\leq H^{*}(f)
$$

is the threshold-degree lower bound from [006_threshold_degree_head_complexity_bound.md](../01_foundations_and_normal_form/006_threshold_degree_head_complexity_bound.md). The upper bound

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq C_{+}(f)
$$

is the positive-projection sign-change theorem [013_positive_projection_sign_changes.md](../01_foundations_and_normal_form/013_positive_projection_sign_changes.md). Therefore, if

$$
\deg_{\pm}(f)=C_{+}(f),
$$

then $H^{*}(f)$ is trapped between two equal numbers, so

$$
H^{*}(f)=\deg_{\pm}(f)=C_{+}(f).
$$

The same proof works with any fixed positive projection $t$: if $f$ factors through $t$, then [013_positive_projection_sign_changes.md](../01_foundations_and_normal_form/013_positive_projection_sign_changes.md) gives

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq C_t(f).
$$

Thus $\deg_{\pm}(f)=C_t(f)$ also forces

$$
H^{*}(f)=C_t(f).
$$

It remains to record the low-alternation case. If $C_{+}(f)\leq2$, then the positive-projection theorem gives

$$
H^{*}(f)\leq2.
$$

If $f$ is constant, then $H^{*}(f)=0$. If $f$ is a nonconstant LTF, the one-head characterization from [011_one_head_characterization.md](../01_foundations_and_normal_form/011_one_head_characterization.md) gives

$$
H^{*}(f)=1.
$$

If $f$ is neither constant nor a nonconstant LTF, the same characterization gives

$$
H^{*}(f)\geq2.
$$

Together with $H^{*}(f)\leq2$, this proves

$$
H^{*}(f)=2.
$$

## Consequences

This lemma gives a reusable proof template:

1. Find a positive projection with $C$ sign changes.
2. Prove $\deg_{\pm}(f)\geq C$.
3. Conclude $H^{*}(f)=C$.

The symmetric exact theorem is one instance: the Hamming-weight projection has $C$ sign changes, and symmetric threshold degree is exactly the same $C$.

The one-run positive-order theorem is the first low-alternation instance. One run gives $C_{+}(f)\leq2$, so every nonconstant non-LTF one-run class has exact value $2$.
