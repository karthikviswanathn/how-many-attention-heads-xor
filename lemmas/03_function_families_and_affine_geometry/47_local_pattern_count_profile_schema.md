# Local-Pattern Count Profile Schema

## Statement

Let

$$
p:\{0,1\}^2\to\{0,1\}
$$

be a two-bit predicate, and let $P_p(a,b)$ be its multilinear polynomial on the Boolean square. For $m\geq1$ and $F:\{0,1,\ldots,m\}\to\{0,1\}$, define

$$
f_{p,F}(x,y)
:=
F\!\left(\sum_{i=1}^{m}p(x_i,y_i)\right),
\qquad
x,y\in\{0,1\}^m.
$$

Let $C(F)$ be the number of sign changes in

$$
F(0),F(1),\ldots,F(m).
$$

For $0\leq C\leq m$, define the local expansion cost $\Lambda_{p,m}(C)$ as follows. For each $S\subseteq\{1,\ldots,m\}$, set

$$
P_{p,S}(x,y):=\prod_{i\in S}P_p(x_i,y_i).
$$

Let $\lambda_{p,m}(C)$ be $1$ if at least one product $P_{p,S}$ with $1\leq\lvert S\rvert\leq C$ contains a nonzero degree-one monomial after multilinear expansion, and $0$ otherwise. Let $\Gamma_{p,m}(C)$ be the set of degree at least two monomials that occur with nonzero coefficient in at least one such product. Define

$$
\Lambda_{p,m}(C):=\lambda_{p,m}(C)+\lvert\Gamma_{p,m}(C)\rvert.
$$

If $C=0$, the index set is empty and $\Lambda_{p,m}(0)=0$.

Suppose $p$ has a symmetric one-bit slice: after fixing one of its two inputs to a constant, the remaining one-bit function is either $z$ or $1-z$. Then

$$
C(F)
\leq
H^{*}(f_{p,F})
\leq
\Lambda_{p,m}(C(F)).
$$

> **Interpretation.** Any count of identical local two-bit patterns inherits a symmetric sign-change lower bound when one slice exposes a free bit. The upper bound is exactly the affine-free monomial cost of expanding a univariate sign polynomial in the local count.

## Proof

### Lemma 1. One-bit slice lower bound

Assume first that fixing one coordinate of $p$ gives the identity function $z$. Applying the same restriction in every pair gives

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{m}p(x_i,y_i)=\sum_{i=1}^{m}z_i
$$

on the restricted cube. Hence $f_{p,F}$ restricts to the symmetric function

$$
z\mapsto F(\lvert z\rvert).
$$

By the symmetric sign-change theorem [06_symmetric_sign_changes.md](../01_foundations_and_normal_form/06_symmetric_sign_changes.md), this restricted function has head complexity $C(F)$. Restriction monotonicity from [22_restrictions_and_sign_rank.md](../02_complexity_measure_upper_bounds/22_restrictions_and_sign_rank.md) gives

$$
H^{*}(f_{p,F})\geq C(F).
$$

If the one-bit slice is $1-z$ instead, the same restriction gives

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{m}p(x_i,y_i)=m-\lvert z\rvert.
$$

The restricted profile has label sequence

$$
F(m),F(m-1),\ldots,F(0),
$$

which has the same number of sign changes as the original sequence. The same symmetric theorem and restriction monotonicity again give

$$
H^{*}(f_{p,F})\geq C(F).
$$

### Lemma 2. A degree-$C(F)$ sign polynomial in the local count

Define

$$
q_k:=
\begin{cases}
+1 & \text{if } F(k)=1,\\
-1 & \text{if } F(k)=0,
\end{cases}
$$

and

$$
\mathcal{J}:=\{j\in\{0,\ldots,m-1\}:q_j\neq q_{j+1}\}.
$$

Let

$$
R(t):=
q_0\prod_{j\in\mathcal{J}}\left(j+\frac{1}{2}-t\right).
$$

As in [44_intersection_profile_bounds.md](44_intersection_profile_bounds.md), this polynomial has degree $C(F)$ and satisfies

$$
q_kR(k)>0
$$

for every $k\in\{0,\ldots,m\}$. Therefore

$$
R\!\left(\sum_{i=1}^{m}p(x_i,y_i)\right)
$$

sign-represents $f_{p,F}$.

### Lemma 3. Expansion-cost upper bound

Since $p$ is Boolean-valued, $P_p(x_i,y_i)^2=P_p(x_i,y_i)$ as a function on the Boolean square. Thus after multilinear reduction, the polynomial from Lemma 2 lies in the span of the products

$$
P_{p,S}(x,y)
$$

with

$$
0\leq\lvert S\rvert\leq C(F).
$$

The constant part is absorbed into the final threshold. By the definition of $\Lambda_{p,m}(C(F))$, all linear monomials appearing in the expansion cost at most one affine head, and all degree at least two monomials appearing in the expansion are contained in $\Gamma_{p,m}(C(F))$.

Therefore the affine-free support cost of this sign polynomial is at most

$$
\Lambda_{p,m}(C(F)).
$$

Applying the affine-free polynomial-threshold sparsity bound [42_affine_free_sparsity_upper_bound.md](42_affine_free_sparsity_upper_bound.md) gives

$$
H^{*}(f_{p,F})
\leq
\Lambda_{p,m}(C(F)).
$$

Together with Lemma 1, this proves the theorem. $\blacksquare$

## Consequence

This schema recovers the three profile families recorded separately in these notes.

1. For $p(a,b)=ab$, the slice $b=1$ gives $a$, and each product over $r$ coordinates is one monomial. Hence

   $$
   \Lambda_{p,m}(C)\leq\sum_{r=1}^{C}\binom{m}{r}.
   $$

   This is the intersection-profile bound from [44_intersection_profile_bounds.md](44_intersection_profile_bounds.md).

2. For $p(a,b)=a\oplus b$, the slice $b=0$ gives $a$, and

   $$
   p(a,b)=a+b-2ab.
   $$

   Thus

   $$
   \Lambda_{p,m}(C)
   \leq
   1+m+\sum_{r=2}^{C}3^r\binom{m}{r}
   $$

   for $C\geq1$. This is the Hamming-distance profile bound from [45_hamming_distance_profile_bounds.md](45_hamming_distance_profile_bounds.md).

3. For $p(a,b)=a(1-b)$, the slice $b=0$ gives $a$, and

   $$
   p(a,b)=a-ab.
   $$

   Thus

   $$
   \Lambda_{p,m}(C)
   \leq
   1+m+\sum_{r=2}^{C}2^r\binom{m}{r}
   $$

   for $C\geq1$. This is the directed-defect profile bound from [46_directed_defect_profile_bounds.md](46_directed_defect_profile_bounds.md).
