# Split Affine-Cylinder Refines Split Affine-Free Support

## Statement

For every Boolean function

$$ f:\lbrace0,1\rbrace^{n}\to\lbrace0,1\rbrace $$

with $n\geq1$,

$$ H^{\ast}(f) \leq \mathrm{actc}(f) \leq \mathrm{sactc}(f) \leq \mathrm{scafs}_{\pm}(f), $$

where $\mathrm{scafs}_{\pm}$ is the split affine-free support invariant from [078_split_affine_free_support_invariant.md](078_split_affine_free_support_invariant.md).

Consequently, every split affine-free support certificate is also a split affine-cylinder certificate of no larger cost.

> **Interpretation.** The affine-cylinder split invariant is a genuine refinement of the earlier split sparse-PTF recursion. It keeps all positive monomial certificates, and it can also exploit mixed-literal cylinders with cheap local expansion.

## Proof

Fix a split coordinate and write inputs as

$$ (z,y)\in\lbrace0,1\rbrace\times\lbrace0,1\rbrace^{n-1}. $$

Let $P_0,P_1$ be strict sign polynomials for the two cofactors, written as in [078_split_affine_free_support_invariant.md](078_split_affine_free_support_invariant.md):

$$ P_b(y) = c_b+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\alpha_{b,i}y_i + \sum_{\substack{S\subseteq\lbrace1,\ldots,n-1\rbrace\\ \lvert S\rvert\geq2}} a_{b,S}\prod_{i\in S}y_i. $$

View each $P_b$ as an affine-cylinder score by taking

$$ A_b(y):=c_b+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\alpha_{b,i}y_i $$

and replacing every nonzero nonlinear monomial by the cylinder

$$ \prod_{i\in S}y_i=C_{S,\varnothing}(y). $$

For such a base nonlinear monomial,

$$ \kappa(S,\varnothing)=1. $$

If the coefficient of the nonlinear monomial changes across the split, the interpolation term is

$$ z\prod_{i\in S}y_i=C_{S\cup\lbrace z\rbrace,\varnothing}(z,y), $$

and again

$$ \kappa(S\cup\lbrace z\rbrace,\varnothing)=1. $$

Therefore the affine-cylinder interpolation cost of these two scores is exactly the split affine-free support cost of the two polynomials:

$$ I(P_0,P_1) = \lambda(P_0,P_1) + \lvert\mathcal{N}_0\rvert + \lvert\mathcal{L}_{\Delta}\rvert + \lvert\mathcal{N}_{\Delta}\rvert. $$

Taking the minimum over $P_0,P_1$ for this split gives

$$ \mathrm{sactc}_{j}(f) \leq \mathrm{scafs}_{\pm,j}(f). $$

Taking the minimum over split coordinates yields

$$ \mathrm{sactc}(f) \leq \mathrm{scafs}_{\pm}(f). $$

The split affine-cylinder cost lemma [112_split_affine_cylinder_cost.md](112_split_affine_cylinder_cost.md) gives

$$ H^{\ast}(f) \leq \mathrm{actc}(f) \leq \mathrm{sactc}(f). $$

Combining the two chains proves the theorem. $\blacksquare$

## Consequences

The old cofactor sparse-polynomial route now factors through the affine-cylinder split invariant:

$$ H^{\ast}(f) \leq \mathrm{sactc}(f) \leq \mathrm{scafs}_{\pm}(f). $$

Thus any improvement to local cylinder scoring immediately improves the recursive split search without losing any certificate already covered by split affine-free support.
